        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>To deal with the global and regional issues including food security, climate change, land degradation, biodiversity loss, water resource management, and ecosystem health, detailed accurate spatial soil information is urgently needed. This drives the worldwide development of digital soil mapping. In recent years, significant progresses have been made in different aspects of digital soil mapping. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a review for the major progresses of digital soil mapping in the last decade. First, we briefly described the rise of digital soil mapping and outlined important milestones and their influence, and main paradigms in digital soil mapping. Then, we reviewed the progresses in legacy soil data, environmental covariates, soil sampling, predictive models and the applications of digital soil mapping products. Finally, we summarized the main trends and future prospect as revealed by studies up to now. We concluded that although the digital soil mapping is now moving towards mature to meet various demands of soil information, challenges including new theories, methodologies and applications of digital soil mapping, especially for highly heterogeneous and human-affected environments, still exist and need to be addressed in the future.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Modelling of the topsoil organic carbon content by analysing the potential of spectroscopic techniques for digital soil mapping</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Tubio2017</b:Tag>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Soil research is being driven by a need to understand the role of soil in the global climate change. The scientific community and policymakers have been expressed the need for spatially referenced information about soil organic carbon distribution. It represents the largest terrestrial carbon pool, being one of the most relevant components in the carbon cycle budget and climate change feedbacks. The advances in computer science have brought enormous potential for improve the manner in that soil maps were produced. The use of new statistical approaches showed the potential of digital soil mapping to inference the spatial distribution of organic carbon content with a limited sampling point scheme. Recently, digital soil mapping has been complemented with visible and infrared spectroscopy, which provides an effective tool to obtain soil organic carbon concentration of soil samples and overcomes the high cost and time-consuming typical of traditional chemical methods.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Remote Sensing Techniques for Soil Organic Carbon Estimation: A Review</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Angelopoulou2019</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>MDPI AG</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Towards the need for sustainable development, remote sensing (RS) techniques in the Visible-Near Infrared–Shortwave Infrared (VNIR–SWIR, 400–2500 nm) region could assist in a more direct, cost-effective and rapid manner to estimate important indicators for soil monitoring purposes. Soil reflectance spectroscopy has been applied in various domains apart from laboratory conditions, e.g., sensors mounted on satellites, aircrafts and Unmanned Aerial Systems. The aim of this review is to illustrate the research made for soil organic carbon estimation, with the use of RS techniques, reporting the methodology and results of each study. It also aims to provide a comprehensive introduction in soil spectroscopy for those who are less conversant with the subject. In total, 28 journal articles were selected and further analysed. It was observed that prediction accuracy reduces from Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) to satellite platforms, though advances in machine learning techniques could further assist in the generation of better calibration models. There are some challenges concerning atmospheric, radiometric and geometric corrections, vegetation cover, soil moisture and roughness that still need to be addressed. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach are highlighted and future considerations are also discussed at the end.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Sampling design optimization for multivariate soil mapping</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Vasat2010</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>Elsevier BV</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Much attention has been paid to sampling design optimization over the past decades. Many methods have been developed and applied, but only a few of these deal with simultaneous optimization of the sampling design for multiple soil variables. In this paper we present a method implemented as R-code that minimizes the average kriging variance (AKV) for multiple soil variables simultaneously. The method is illustrated with real soil data from an experimental field in central Czech Republic. The goal of the method is to minimize the sample size while keeping the AKV values of all tested soil variables below given thresholds. We defined and tested two different objective functions, critical AKV optimization and weighted sum of AKV optimization, both based on the AKV minimization with annealing algorithm. The crucial moment for such an optimization is defining the mutual spatial relationship between all soil variables with the Linear Model of Coregionalization and proper modelling of all (cross)variograms which are used in the optimization process. In addition, a separate optimization was made for each of the tested soil characteristics to evaluate a possible gain of the simultaneous approach.

The results showed that the final design for multivariate sampling is “fully-optimal” for one soil variable — optimal number of observations and optimal structure of sampling pattern, and “sub-optimal” for the others, while no clear difference between the two optimization criteria was found. We can recommend using the method in situations where periodical soil surveys are planned and where multivariate soil characteristics are determined from the same soil samples at once.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Sampling designs for validating digital soil maps: a review</b:Title>

        <b:Publisher>Elsevier</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Sampling design (SD) plays a crucial role in providing reliable input for digital soil mapping (DSM) and increasing its efficiency. Sampling design, with a predetermined sample size and consideration of budget and spatial variability, is a selection procedure for identifying a set of sample locations spread over a geographical space or with a good feature space coverage. A good feature space coverage ensures accurate estimation of regression parameters, while spatial coverage contributes to effective spatial interpolation. First, we review several statistical and geometric SDs that mainly optimize the sampling pattern in a geographical space and illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of these SDs by considering spatial coverage, simplicity, accuracy, and efficiency. Furthermore, Latin hypercube sampling, which obtains a full representation of multivariate distribution in geographical space, is described in detail for its development, improvement, and application. In addition, we discuss the fuzzy k-means sampling, response surface sampling, and Kennard-Stone sampling, which optimize sampling patterns in a feature space. We then discuss some practical applications that are mainly addressed by the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling with the flexibility and feasibility of adding multiple optimization criteria. We also discuss different methods of validation, an important stage of DSM, and conclude that an independent dataset selected from the probability sampling is superior for its free model assumptions. For future work, we recommend: 1) exploring SDs with both good spatial coverage and feature space coverage; 2) uncovering the real impacts of an SD on the integral DSM procedure; and 3) testing the feasibility and contribution of SDs in three-dimensional (3D) DSM with variability for multiple layers.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Digital mapping: new approach on soil survey</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Dalmolin2015</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias de la Salud</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Increasingly intensive use of soil and its disorganized occupancy result in its degradation. There is a lack of more detailed information on soils and on soil surveys. Soil mappings are key for land sustainable management because they provide basic information about this natural resource and its distribution on the landscape. The production of highly detailed soil class and attribute maps, will only be possible using geotechnologies in combination with field data. The objective of this review was to emphasize the importance of soil surveys within a new paradigm, defined as Digital Soil Mapping (DSM). DSM requires: i) the use of data from field sampling and analytical results from laboratories, including existing as well as newly collected data ii) the process of inference and of spacing includes a proposition of mathematical and statistical models based on soil observation, environmental covariates and other scorpan factors iii) results should be presented as soil spatial system format with continuous and/or discrete data, added to the uncertainty of this information, which could be updated whenever new observations become available. The application of DSM will make it possible for soil spatial information, attributes and classes to be generated and be readily available in digital format with its associated uncertainty. Among the challenges for further implementation of several strategies available in DSM, the training of future generations of soil scientists should be a priority.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Digital soil mapping (DSM) has been widely used as a cost-effective method for generating soil maps. However, current DSM data representation rarely incorporates contextual information of the landscape. DSM models are usually calibrated using point observations intersected with spatially corresponding point covariates. Here, we demonstrate the use of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model that incorporates contextual information surrounding an observation to significantly improve the prediction accuracy over conventional DSM models. We describe a CNN model that takes inputs as images of covariates and explores spatial contextual information by finding non-linear local spatial relationships of neighbouring pixels. Unique features of the proposed model include input represented as a 3-D stack of images, data augmentation to reduce overfitting, and the simultaneous prediction of multiple outputs. Using a soil mapping example in Chile, the CNN model was trained to simultaneously predict soil organic carbon at multiples depths across the country. The results showed that, in this study, the CNN model reduced the error by 30 % compared with conventional techniques that only used point information of covariates. In the example of country-wide mapping at 100 m resolution, the neighbourhood size from 3 to 9 pixels is more effective than at a point location and larger neighbourhood sizes. In addition, the CNN model produces less prediction uncertainty and it is able to predict soil carbon at deeper soil layers more accurately. Because the CNN model takes the covariate represented as images, it offers a simple and effective framework for future DSM models.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Due to confounding factors such as crop residue and soil moisture, soil organic matter (SOM) is usually estimated from soil samples in a laboratory or in the field at a local scale. In this study, laboratory and field data of crop residue, soil moisture, crop management practices, and SOM content were used in concert with multi-temporal MODIS images captured during bare soil periods over three years to construct spectral indices, which were then used as input variables to build a regional-scale SOM prediction model. Results showed that: (1) multi-temporal satellite images can be used to predict SOM content at a regional scale; (2) crop residue cover and time interval between snow melt, rainfall, and ploughing determined the optimal input variables for SOM prediction; (3) compared to a SOM model based on a single image, a multi-temporal model reduced the influence of soil moisture and improved both the stability and the accuracy of SOM prediction; (4) the best models generally used the ratio of MODIS Band 6 and Band 1 (R61) as an input variable, as R61 showed good correlation with SOM and less correlation with moisture; and (5) comparing different models in different years showed that models performed better in years with less crop residue. The study results can be used to improve the accuracy of quantitative estimates of the soil organic carbon pool and provide assistance in digital soil mapping.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Sampling design optimization for soil mapping with random forest</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Wadoux2019</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>Elsevier BV</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Machine learning techniques are widely employed to generate digital soil maps. The map accuracy is partly determined by the number and spatial locations of the measurements used to calibrate the machine learning model. However, determining the optimal sampling design for mapping with machine learning techniques has not yet been considered in detail in digital soil mapping studies. In this paper, we investigate sampling design optimization for soil mapping with random forest. A design is optimized using spatial simulated annealing by minimizing the mean squared prediction error (MSE). We applied this approach to mapping soil organic carbon for a part of Europe using subsamples of the LUCAS dataset. The optimized subsamples are used as input for the random forest machine learning model, using a large set of readily available environmental data as covariates. We also predicted the same soil property using subsamples selected by simple random sampling, conditioned Latin Hypercube sampling (cLHS), spatial coverage sampling and feature space coverage sampling. Distributions of the estimated population MSEs are obtained through repeated random splitting of the LUCAS dataset, serving as the population of interest, into subsets used for validation, testing and selection of calibration samples, and repeated selection of calibration samples with the various sampling designs. The differences between the medians of the MSE distributions were tested for significance using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. The process was repeated for different sample sizes. We also analyzed the spread of the optimized designs in both geographic and feature space to reveal their characteristics. Results show that optimization of the sampling design by minimizing the MSE is worthwhile for small sample sizes. However, an important disadvantage of sampling design optimization using MSE is that it requires known values of the soil property at all locations and as a consequence is only feasible for subsampling an existing dataset. For larger sample sizes, the effect of using an MSE optimized design diminishes. In this case, we recommend to use a sample spread uniformly in the feature (i.e. covariate) space of the most important random forest covariates. The results also show that for our case study, cLHS sampling performs worse than the other sampling designs for mapping with random forest. We stress that comparison of sampling designs for calibration by splitting the data just once is very sensitive to the data split that one happens to use if the validation set is small.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Soil Texture Estimation Using Radar and Optical Data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Bousbih2019</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>MDPI AG</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>This paper discusses the combined use of remotely sensed optical and radar data for the estimation and mapping of soil texture. The study is based on Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data acquired between July and early December 2017, on a semi-arid area about 3000 km2 in central Tunisia. In addition to satellite acquisitions, texture measurement samples were taken in several agricultural fields, characterized by a large range of clay contents (between 13% and 60%). For the period between July and August, various optical indicators of clay content Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands and soil indices) were tested over bare soils. Satellite moisture products, derived from combined S-1 and S-2 data, were also tested as an indicator of soil texture. Algorithms based on the support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) methods are proposed for the classification and mapping of clay content and a three-fold cross-validation is used to evaluate both approaches. The classifications with the best performance are achieved using the soil moisture indicator derived from combined S-1 and S-2 data, with overall accuracy (OA) of 63% and 65% for the SVM and RF classifications, respectively.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Satellite data integration for soil clay content modelling at a national scale</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Loiseau2019</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>Elsevier BV</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Soil clay content is a key parameter that influences many other soil properties and processes. The potential of adding new and contemporary satellite data for soil property mapping in France is assessed in this study. The soil property maps used for this analysis were produced within the framework of GlobalSoilMap, which was created to deliver global fine grids of soil properties and associated uncertainties using existing soil information and ancillary data to predict these properties based on digital soil mapping techniques. In this study, we evaluate the added value of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Project for On-Board Autonomy-Vegetation (PROBA-V), and Sentinel-2 (S2) data for predicting the soil clay content at 90 m resolution for mainland France. The rationale behind adding these data is that satellite images and derived products may enable the biogeochemical characteristics of the earth’s surface to be captured more effectively, which in turn enables more precise predictions of the soil clay content. For this methodology, we i) create composite bare soil mosaics and derive the spectral indices from S2 data acquired during sowing periods from 2016 to 2017, ii) extract the first three principal components of harmonized MODIS and PROBA-V normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series acquired in 2003 and 2016 to represent vegetation changes, and iii) test whether the complementary datasets are able to improve the soil clay information compared to a benchmark value. The soil clay content is obtained by using quantile regression forest (QRF) for each GlobalSoilMap depth interval of 0–5 cm, 5–15 cm, 15–30 cm, 30–60 cm, 60–100 cm, and 100–200 cm along with a 10-fold cross-validation having 10 replicates. The results show that the complementary satellite data improve the clay content estimation on bare soil for the topsoil layers (e.g., 0–30 cm) by increasing the R² and decreasing the bias at averages of 0.05 and 1 g kg−1, respectively. Moreover, the first principal component of the harmonized NDVI data is shown to be the second most important variable for estimating the clay content, as indicated by the QRF models. However, the use of only the satellite data and products as input for the QRF does not yield a satisfactory estimate of the clay content. Finally, this work provides a reference for embedding new remote sensing data in existing national soil inventories and national soil information systems. Further research should incorporate new techniques for considering the spatial–temporal variability of the earth’s surface parameters such as soil moisture and roughness.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Using model predictions of soil carbon in farm-scale auditing - A software tool</b:Title>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>We introduce a software tool for optimal sampling design in the context of farm-scale soil carbon auditing, where the amount of sequestered soil carbon will be estimated from a random sample. Existing tools do not use available ancillary information, or do not have the functionality needed for farm-scale soil carbon auditing. Using a grid of predicted carbon content with associated uncertainty, the software optimises a stratified random sampling design, such that the profit is maximised on the basis of sequestered carbon price, sampling costs, and a trading parameter that balances farmer's and buyer's risks due to uncertainty of the estimated amount of sequestered carbon. As the algorithm is computationally intensive, the package is written in Julia for speed. From a case study we conclude that our software is an effective tool for farm-scale soil carbon auditing, and that it outperforms the existing tools in terms of efficiency and functionality.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Uncertainty-guided sampling to improve digital soil maps</b:Title>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Digital soil mapping (DSM) products represent estimates of spatially distributed soil properties. These estimations comprise an element of uncertainty that is not evenly distributed over the area covered by DSM. If we quantify the uncertainty spatially explicit, this information can be used to improve the quality of DSM by optimizing the sampling design. This study follows a DSM approach using a Random Forest regression model, legacy soil samples, and terrain covariates to estimate topsoil silt and clay contents in a small catchment of 4.2 km2 in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, Central China. We aim (i) to introduce a method to derive spatial uncertainty, and (ii) to improve the initial DSM approaches by additional sampling that is guided by the spatial uncertainty. The proposed uncertainty measure is based on multiple realizations of individual and randomized decision tree models. We used the spatial uncertainty of the initial DSM approaches to stratify the study area and thereby to identify potential sampling areas of high uncertainties. Further, we tested how precisely available legacy samples cover the variability of the covariates within each potential sampling area to define the final sampling area and to apply a purposive sampling design. For the final Random Forest model calibration, we combined the legacy sample set with the additional samples. This uncertainty-driven DSM refinement was evaluated by comparing it to a second approach. In this second approach, the additional samples were replaced by a random sample set of the same size, obtained from the entire study area. For the comparative analysis, external, bootstrap-, and cross-validation was applied. The DSM approach using the uncertainty-driven refinement performed best. The averaged spatial uncertainty was reduced by 31% for silt and by 27% for clay compared to the initial DSM approach. Using external validation, the accuracy increased by the same proportions, while showing an overall accuracy of R2 = 0.59 for silt and R2 = 0.56 for clay.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>A comparison of importance of modelling method and sample size for mapping soil organic matter in Guangdong, China</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Lai2021</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>Elsevier BV</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Digital soil mapping (DSM) is the most widely used method for producing spatial information of soil organic matter (SOM). Accuracy of the information is generally determined by modelling methods and sample sizes used for DSM. However, different studies present different importance of modelling method and sample size on accuracy of DSM, while they do not explore various combinations of modelling method and sample size. Based on the studies, it is supposed that there exists an optimal combination of modelling method and sample size for producing information of SOM accurately and economically. With SOM data of 1861 soil samples collected in Guangdong, China, the present study first assessed importance of modelling method and sample size and then examined if an optimal combination of modelling method and sample size existed for the area. Six modelling methods were explored, while 12 sample sizes were used, ranging from 100 to 1200 with an interval of 100. For each size, 10 repeated samples were randomly taken from a data of 1311 samples which were randomly selected from all the 1861 soil samples based on the probability distribution of the SOM data. The results showed that, for small sample sizes, the modelling methods have a greater impact on accuracy of DSM. However, for large sample sizes, e.g., more than 1000, the sample sizes have a much greater impact. Due to the varying importance of modelling method and sample size, there exists an optimal combination of modelling method and sample size for spatial prediction of SOM in the area, i.e., the combination of regression kriging and a sample size of 800. Thus, for economically producing detailed and accurate information on spatial distribution of SOM, it is recommended that a series of modelling methods and sample sizes are tried to identify an optimal combination of modelling method and sample size.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Probability mapping of soil thickness by random survival forest at a national scale</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Chen2019</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>Elsevier BV</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Soil thickness (ST) is a crucial factor in earth surface modelling and soil storage capacity calculations (e.g., available water capacity and carbon stocks). However, the observed depths recorded in soil information systems for some profiles are often less than the actual ST (i.e., right censored data). The use of such data will negatively affect model and map accuracy, yet few studies have been done to resolve this issue or propose methods to correct for right censored data. Therefore, this work demonstrates how right censored data can be accounted for in the ST modelling of mainland France. We propose the use of Random Survival Forest (RSF) for ST probability mapping within a Digital Soil Mapping framework. Among 2109 sites of the French Soil Monitoring Network, 1089 observed STs were defined as being right censored. Using RSF, the probability of exceeding a given depth was modelled using freely available spatial data representing the main soil-forming factors. Subsequently, the models were extrapolated to the full spatial extent of mainland France. As examples, we produced maps showing the probability of exceeding the thickness of each GlobalSoilMap standard depth: 5, 15, 30, 60, 100, and 200 cm. In addition, a bootstrapping approach was used to assess the 90% confidence intervals. Our results showed that RSF was able to correct for right censored data entries occurring within a given dataset. RSF was more reliable for thin (0.3 m) and thick soils (1 to 2 m), as they performed better (overall accuracy from 0.793 to 0.989) than soils with a thickness between 0.3 and 1 m. This study provides a new approach for modelling right censored soil information. Moreover, RSF can produce probability maps at any depth less than the maximum depth of the calibration data, which is of great value for designing additional sampling campaigns and decision making in geotechnical engineering.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>The purpose of the study is to map the spatial variation of major soil properties in Bukkarayasamudrum mandal of Anantapur district, India using Random Forest model. The study area is divided into different Physiographic Land Units (PLU) based on landform, landuse and slope. Random Forest model (RFM) was developed based on field survey data of 116 surface samples (0–30 cm) representing all major PLU units of the study area. RFM is neither sensitive to over fitting nor to noise features and has capacity to handle large datasets. High resolution satellite imagery (IRS LISS IV data- 3 bands), terrain attributes such as elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index, topographic position index, plan &amp; profile curvature, Multi-resolution index of valley bottom flatness and Multi-resolution ridge top flatness, Vegetation factors like NDVI, EVI and land use land cover (LULC) are used as covariates along with legacy soil data of 1:50,000 scale. The predicted organic carbon, pH and EC ranged from 0.24–1.03%, 6.9–9.0, 0.11–0.97 dsm− 1 respectively. The model performance was evaluated based on Coefficient of determination (R2) and Lin's Concordance coefficient (CCC). The model performed well with R2 and CCC values of 0.23 and 0.38 for SOC, 0.30 and 0.37 for pH, and 0.62 and 0.70 for EC respectively. Variable importance ranking of RFM model showed that EVI and NDVI are the most important predictors for organic carbon whereas drainage and NDVI for EC and pH respectively. This technique can be applied to similar landscapes with more observations to refine the spatial resolution of soil properties.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Soil organic carbon (SOC) loss is one of the main causes of soil degradation in croplands. Thus, spatial and temporal monitoring of SOC is extremely important, both from the environmental and economic perspective. In this regard, the high temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution of the Sentinel-2 data can be exploited for monitoring SOC contents in the topsoil of croplands. In this study, we aim to test the effect of the threshold for a spectral index linked to soil moisture and crop residues on the performance of SOC prediction models using the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) Sentinel-2 and the European Land Use/cover Area frame Statistical survey (LUCAS) topsoil database. The LUCAS spectral data resampled according to MSI/Sentinel-2 bands, which were used to build SOC prediction models combining pairs of the bands. The SOC models were applied to a Sentinel-2 image acquired in North-Eastern Germany after removing the pixels characterized by clouds and green vegetation. Then, we tested different thresholds of the Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (NBR2) index in order to mask moist soil pixels and those with dry vegetation and crop residues. The model accuracy was tested on an independent validation database and the best ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) was obtained using the average between bands B6 and B5 (Red-Edge Carbon Index: RE-CI) (RPD: 4.4) and between B4 and B5 (Red-Red-Edge Carbon Index: RRE-CI) (RPD: 2.9) for a very low NBR2 threshold (0.05). Employing a higher NBR2 tolerance (higher NBR2 values), the mapped area increases to the detriment of the validation accuracy. The proposed approach allowed us to accurately map SOC over a large area exploiting the LUCAS spectral library and, thus, avoid a new ad hoc field campaign. Moreover, the threshold for selecting the bare soil pixels can be tuned, according to the goal of the survey. The quality of the SOC map for each tolerance level can be judged based on the figures of merit of the model.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Error index for additional sampling to map soil contaminant grades</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Gao2017</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>Elsevier BV</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Soil contaminant grades classified by thresholds of concentrations are important for land use and management. Mapping of the soil contaminant grades only focuses on the precise prediction of the relationship between the contaminant concentration of each spatial units and a predefined threshold. Thus, unlike sampling for other purposes, additional sampling should add more sites in areas with a high possibility of misclassification and fewer or no sites in areas with a low possibility of misclassification. To guide additional sampling for mapping of the soil contaminant grades, an error index based on Indicator Kriging (IK) is proposed in this paper. By linear transformation of the predicted value of IK and summing the standard variance of the prediction error, the error index contains both the closeness of predicted value to the threshold and the uncertainty of the prediction, and can reflect the possibility of misclassification of the soil contaminant grades. Also, due to the adoption of IK, it can avoid the smoothing effect, remove or lower the unstationary variation of original data by indicator transform, and do not required normal distribution to model the error variance. Based on the error index, an optimization method for additional sampling to map soil contaminant grades is then put forward by defining an objective function and employing the Spatial Simulated Annealing optimization method. The chromium concentration data of the study area in central China were used as a case study. According to a comparison of the proposed additional sampling optimization method with spatially even sampling method and spatially random sampling method, the case study demonstrated that the proposed optimization method based on the error index is superior to the other methods in improving the prediction precision of soil contaminant grades and that its performance is stable. The results suggest that the error index proposed in this paper can be used to generate a design for additional sampling to improve the mapping precision of soil contaminant grades.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>A large number of predictor variables can be used in digital soil mapping; however, the presence of irrelevant covariables may compromise the prediction of soil types. Thus, algorithms can be applied to select the most relevant predictors. This study aimed to compare three covariable selection systems (two filter algorithms and one wrapper algorithm) and assess their impacts on the predictive model. The study area was the Lajeado River Watershed in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. We used forty predictor covariables, derived from a digital elevation model with 30 m resolution, in which the three selection models were applied and separated into subsets. These subsets were used to assess performance by applying four prediction algorithms. The wrapper method obtained the best performance values for the predictive model in all the algorithms evaluated. The three selection methods applied reduced the number of covariables in the predictive models by 70 % and enabled prediction of the 14 soil mapping units.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Digital soil mapping and GlobalSoilMap. Main advances and ways forward</b:Title>

        <b:Publisher>Elsevier BV</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>In this concluding paper, we summarize the main advances coming forward from the joint conference of the International Union of Soil Sciences (IUSS) Working Groups (WG) “Digital Soil mapping” (DSM) and “GlobalSoilMap”. We outline the increased availability of data and covariates. Large efforts to rescue legacy data and to put them in a harmonized format are ongoing in many parts of the world. New countries are joining the GlobalSoilMap initiative. During the same time, significant progress have been made in the countries which were among the first to develop GlobalSoilMap products. We stress the recent trends in tools used for predictive mapping of soil properties. Some solutions were proposed to solve issues about data privacy. We give examples on how to move from DSM soil digital soil mapping assessment. Aligning our research with ongoing activities within the Global Soil Partnership of the FAO has been proven successful. A need was expressed to work on the uncertainty of indicators of prediction performances and to re-evaluate validation strategies. It is necessary to develop more intuitive metrics for uncertainty assessment for interpreting and evaluating soil maps. The main progresses, remaining issues and challenges and the way forward are summarized and we propose ambitious working plans and road-maps for the two WGs and stress their complementarities.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Key variables for the identification of soil management classes in the aeolian landscapes of north–west Europe</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Meirvenne2013</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>Elsevier BV</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>At present, spatially very detailed data sets can be obtained about soil, landscape and crop variability. However, there is a need to select independent key properties to identify management classes needed for precise land management. In a previous study performed in the European loess belt, topsoil pH, apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) and elevation were identified as key properties. In this study we enlarged the number of soil properties by including gamma ray measurements and employed a similar methodology to a field in the sand belt of northern Europe. Based on a principal component analysis we identified the same three variables as key properties. This was surprising given the big differences in landscape topology and pedogenesis between the loess and sand areas. These three key variables were used to delineate management classes using a fuzzy k-means with extragrade classification procedure. This classification was evaluated by mapping the wheat grain yield in the year 2006. A multiple regression model could be constructed that predicted yield from ECa and elevation well (Radj2 = 0.88). To analyse the influence of ECa on crop yield in depth a boundary line analysis was conducted. The boundary line could be modelled with an excellent Radj2 of 0.98. It was concluded that ECa, elevation and pH are generic key variables for the delineation of management classes of the aeolian landscapes of north–west Europe. Given its integral nature and strong relationship with crop performances, the authors plea to upgrade ECa from a “secondary” (proxy) source of information to a “primary” variable which can be used directly as a basis for detailed soil mapping of the bulk soil.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Comparing three approaches of spatial disaggregation of legacy soil maps based on the Disaggregation and Harmonisation of Soil Map Units Through Resampled Classification Trees (DSMART) algorithm</b:Title>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Enhancing the spatial resolution of pedological information is a great challenge in the field of digital soil mapping (DSM). Several techniques have emerged to disaggregate conventional soil maps initially and are available at a coarser spatial resolution than required for solving environmental and agricultural issues. At the regional level, polygon maps represent soil cover as a tessellation of polygons defining soil map units (SMUs), where each SMU can include one or several soil type units (STUs) with given proportions derived from expert knowledge. Such polygon maps can be disaggregated at a finer spatial resolution by machine-learning algorithms, using the Disaggregation and Harmonisation of Soil Map Units Through Resampled Classification Trees (DSMART) algorithm. This study aimed to compare three approaches of the spatial disaggregation of legacy soil maps based on DSMART decision trees to test the hypothesis that the disaggregation of soil landscape distribution rules may improve the accuracy of the resulting soil maps. Overall, two modified DSMART algorithms (DSMART with extra soil profiles; DSMART with soil landscape relationships) and the original DSMART algorithm were tested. The quality of disaggregated soil maps at a 50 m resolution was assessed over a large study area (6775 km2) using an external validation based on 135 independent soil profiles selected by probability sampling, 755 legacy soil profiles and existing detailed 1:25 000 soil maps. Pairwise comparisons were also performed, using the Shannon entropy measure, to spatially locate the differences between disaggregated maps. The main results show that adding soil landscape relationships to the disaggregation process enhances the performance of the prediction of soil type distribution. Considering the three most probable STUs and using 135 independent soil profiles, the overall accuracy measures (the percentage of soil profiles where predictions meet observations) are 19.8 % for DSMART with expert rules against 18.1 % for the original DSMART and 16.9 % for DSMART with extra soil profiles. These measures were almost 2 times higher when validated using 3×3 windows. They achieved 28.5 % for DSMART with soil landscape relationships and 25.3 % and 21 % for original DSMART and DSMART with extra soil observations, respectively. In general, adding soil landscape relationships and extra soil observations constraints allow the model to predict a specific STU that can occur in specific environmental conditions. Thus, including global soil landscape expert rules in the DSMART algorithm is crucial for obtaining consistent soil maps with a clear internal disaggregation of SMUs across the landscape.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Evaluating the capability of the Sentinel 2 data for soil organic carbon prediction in croplands</b:Title>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>The short revisit time of the Sentinel-2 (S2) constellation entails a large availability of remote sensing data, but S2 data have been rarely used to predict soil organic carbon (SOC) content. Thus, this study aims at comparing the capability of multispectral S2 and airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data for SOC prediction, and at the same time, we investigated the importance of spectral and spatial resolution through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the variable importance in the prediction (VIP) models and the spatial variability of the SOC maps at field and regional scales. We tested the capability of the S2 data to predict SOC in croplands with quite different soil types and parent materials in Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium, using multivariate statistics and local ground calibration with soil samples. We split the calibration dataset into sub-regions according to soil maps and built a multivariate regression model within each sub-region. The prediction accuracy obtained by S2 data is generally slightly lower than that retrieved by airborne hyperspectral data. The ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) is higher than 2 in Luxembourg (2.6) and German (2.2) site, while it is 1.1 in the Belgian area. After the spectral resampling of the airborne data according to S2 band, the prediction accuracy did not change for four out of five of the sub-regions. The variable importance values obtained by S2 data showed the same trend as the airborne VIP values, while the importance of SWIR bands decreased using airborne data resampled according the S2 bands. These differences of VIP values can be explained by the loss of spectral resolution as compared to APEX data and the strong difference in terms of SNR between the SWIR region and other spectral regions. The investigation on the spatial variability of the SOC maps derived by S2 data has shown that the spatial resolution of S2 is adequate to describe SOC variability both within field and at regional scale.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>How to map soil organic carbon stocks in highly urbanized regions?</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Vasenev2014</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>Elsevier BV</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Urbanization is among the most impetuous current land-use change trends, resulting in a permanently increasing role of urban ecosystems in regional and global environments. Urban soil organic carbon (SOC) is probably the least understood stocks because of the lack of appropriate methodology to analyze and map it. Cities represent a small-scale patchwork of very contrasting soil features. This creates high short-term spatial variability. Urban-specific factors including size and age of the city, soil sealing and cut-off profiles dominate the anthropogenic soil forming factors. Considering these specific urban environments, our study aimed to adapt the digital soil mapping (DSM) approach to map topsoil and subsoil SOC stocks in a highly urbanized region. Field SOC data collected for different environmental conditions in the Moscow region (five soil types and five land-use types of 244 mixed samples for topsoil and subsoil) were linked to available auxiliary data, including both traditional (relief, climate, vegetation etc.) and urban-specific (functional zoning, size and history of the settlements) factors. Separate general linear models (GLM) were developed for the three different cases: i) excluding urban areas from the analysis (non-urban model); ii) including urban areas but only considering traditional soil forming factors (conventional model); and iii) including urban factors (urban-specific model). Total and specific carbon stocks, spatial variability represented by coefficient of variance (CV %) and the determination coefficient with a validation dataset were compared for the three models. The conventional model dramatically overestimated carbon stocks and underestimated of SOC's spatial variability. Total and specific carbon stocks estimated by non-urban model were 10–15% less than ones given by urban-specific model. The urban-specific performed best and explained more than 30% of total variability. Urban areas showed the highest spatial variability and specific carbon stocks, 90% of which was stored in subsoils. Even when the high uncertainty of the absolute values is considered, urban areas contributed to regional carbon stocks. Considering urban-specific factors to estimate carbon stocks and their spatial variability is thus necessary.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Knowledge of how many sampling points are needed to estimate the mean content of soil nutrients in agricultural fields, given a precision requirement on the estimated mean, is limited. This paper describes a versatile geostatistical simulation approach for predicting the variance of the mean nitrate-N (NO3-N) content within an agricultural field estimated by random sampling. In fall of 2016 sixteen agricultural fields were sampled on a square grid to model the spatial variation of NO3-N. On twelve out of sixteen fields NO3-N showed a lognormal distribution rather than a normal distribution. Variograms for (log-transformed) NO3-N are estimated using a Bayesian approach, resulting in 100 vectors with possible variogram parameters per field, obtained by MCMC sampling from the posterior distribution. Each of these variograms is used to simulate 100 maps of NO3-N, resulting in 100 × 100 maps of NO3-N per field. Each map is used to compute the variance of the estimated mean with stratified simple random sampling of points, with one point per compact geographical stratum. For each sample size (number of sampling points) the mean, median and P90 of the uncertainty distribution are computed. Based on the medians, the sample size required for a maximum expanded measurement uncertainty of 50% varies from to . This large variation in required sample size shows the large variation among the sixteen fields in variance of NO3-N within a field.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Digital soil mapping from conventional field soil observations</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Balkovic2013</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>We tested the performance of a formalized digital soil mapping (DSM) approach comprising fuzzy k-means (FKM) classification and regression-kriging to produce soil type maps from a fine-scale soil observation network in Rišňovce, Slovakia. We examine whether the soil profile descriptions collected merely by field methods fit into the statistical DSM tools and if they provide pedologically meaningful results for an erosion-affected area. Soil texture, colour, carbonates, stoniness and genetic qualifiers were estimated for a total of 111 soil profiles using conventional field methods. The data were digitized along semi-quantitative scales in 10-cm depth intervals to express the relative differences, and afterwards classified by the FKM method into four classes A–D: (i) Luvic Phaeozems (Anthric), (ii) Haplic Phaeozems (Anthric, Calcaric, Pachic), (iii) Calcic Cutanic Luvisols, and (iv) Haplic Regosols (Calcaric). To parameterize regression-kriging, membership values (MVs) to the above A–D class centroids were regressed against PCA-transformed terrain variables using the multiple linear regression method (MLR). MLR yielded significant relationships with R2 ranging from 23% to 47% (P &lt; 0.001) for classes A, B and D, but only marginally significant for Luvisols of class C (R2 = 14%, P &lt; 0.05). Given the results, Luvisols were then mapped by ordinary kriging and the rest by regression-kriging. A “leave-one-out” cross-validation was calculated for the output maps yielding R2 of 33%, 56%, 22% and 42% for Luvic Phaeozems, Haplic Phaeozems, Luvisols and also Regosols, respectively (all P &lt; 0.001). Additionally, the pixel-mixture visualization technique was used to draw a synthetic digital soil map. We conclude that the DSM model represents a fully formalized alternative to classical soil mapping at very fine scales, even when soil profile descriptions were collected merely by field estimation methods. Additionally to conventional soil maps it allows to address the diffuse character in soil cover, both in taxonomic and geographical interpretations.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Using deep learning for multivariate mapping of soil with quantified uncertainty</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Wadoux2019a</b:Tag>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques are widely employed to generate soil maps. Soil properties are typically predicted individually, while ignoring the interrelation between them. Models for predicting multiple properties exist, but they are computationally demanding and often fail to provide accurate description of the associated uncertainty. In this paper a convolutional neural network (CNN) model is described to predict several soil properties with quantified uncertainty. CNN has the advantage that it incorporates spatial contextual information of environmental covariates surrounding an observation. A single CNN model can be trained to predict multiple soil properties simultaneously. I further propose a two-step approach to estimate the uncertainty of the prediction for mapping using a neural network model. The methodology is tested mapping six soil properties on the French metropolitan territory using measurements from the LUCAS dataset and a large set of environmental covariates portraying the factors of soil formation. Results indicate that the multivariate CNN model produces accurate maps as shown by the coefficient of determination and concordance correlation coefficient, compared to a conventional machine learning technique. For this country extent mapping, the maps predicted by CNN have a detailed pattern with significant spatial variation. Evaluation of the uncertainty maps using the median of the standardized squared prediction error and accuracy plots suggests that the uncertainty was accurately quantified, albeit slightly underestimated. The tests conducted using different window size of input covariates to predict the soil properties indicate that CNN benefits from using local contextual information in a radius of 4.5 km. I conclude that CNN is an effective model to predict several soil properties and that the associated uncertainty can be accurately quantified with the proposed approach.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Modelling the topsoil carbon stock of agricultural lands with the Stochastic Gradient Treeboost in a semi-arid Mediterranean region</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Schillaci2017</b:Tag>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Efficient modelling methods to assess soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks have a pivotal importance as inputs for global carbon cycle studies and decision-making processes. However, laboratory analyses of SOC field samples are costly and time consuming. Global-scale estimates of SOC were recently made according to categorical variables, including land use and soil texture. Remote sensing (RS) data can contribute to the better modelling of the spatial distribution of SOC stock at a regional scale. In the present study, we used Stochastic Gradient Treeboost (SGT) to estimate the topsoil (0–30 cm) SOC stock of a Mediterranean semiarid area (Sicily, Italy, 25,286 km2). In particular, our study examined agricultural lands, which represent approximately 64% of the entire region. An extensive soil dataset (2202 samples, 1 profile/7.31 km2 on average) was acquired from the soil database of Sicily. The georeferenced field observations were intersected with remotely sensed environmental data and other spatial data, including climatic data from WORLDCLIM, land cover from CORINE, soil texture, topography and derived indices. Finally, the SGT was compared to published global estimates (GSOC) and data from the International Soil Reference and Information Centre (ISRIC) Soil Grids by comparing the pseudo-regressions of the SGT, GSOC and ISRIC with soil observations. The mean SOC stock across the entire region that was estimated by GSOC and ISRIC was 3.9% lower and 46.2% higher compared to the SGT. The SGT efficiently predicted SOC stocks that were &lt; 70 t ha− 1 (corresponding to the 90th percentile of the observed values). On average, the coefficient of variation of the SGT model was 3.6% when computed on the whole dataset and remained lower than 23% when computed on a distribution basis. The SGT mean absolute error was 14.84 t ha− 1, 18.4% and 36.3% lower than GSOC and ISRIC, respectively. The mean annual rainfall, soil texture, land use, mean annual temperature and Landsat 7 ETM+ panchromatic Band 8 were the most important predictors of SOC stock. Finally, SOC stocks were estimated for each land cover class. SGT predicted SOC stock better than GSOC and ISRIC for most data. This resulted in a percentage of data in the prediction confidence interval ± 50% compared to the observed values of 71.4%, 65.8%, and 50.7% for SGT, GSOC, and SGT, respectively. This consisted of a higher R2 and a slope (β) that was closer to 1 for the pseudo-regression constructed with SGT compared to GSOC and ISRIC. In conclusion, the results of the present study showed that the integration of RS with climatic and soil texture spatial data could strongly improve SOC prediction in a semi-arid Mediterranean region. In addition, the panchromatic band of Landsat 7 ETM + was more predictive compared to the conventionally used NDVI. This information is crucial to guiding decision-making processes, especially at a regional scale and/or in semi-arid Mediterranean areas. The model performance of the SGT could be further improved by adopting predictors with greater spatial resolutions. The results of the present experiment yield valuable information, especially for assessing climate change or land use change scenarios for SOC stocks and their spatial distribution.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Random Forests Applied as a Soil Spatial Predictive Model in Arid Utah</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>stum2010random</b:Tag>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Initial soil surveys are incomplete for large tracts of public land in the western USA. Digital soil mapping offers a quantitative approach as an alternative to traditional soil mapping. I sought to predict soil classes across an arid to semiarid watershed of western Utah by applying random forests (RF) and using environmental covariates derived from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and digital elevation models (DEM). Random forests are similar to classification and regression trees (CART). However, RF is doubly random. Many (e.g., 500) weak trees are grown (trained) independently because each tree is trained with a new randomly selected bootstrap sample, and a random subset of variables is used to split each node. To train and validate the RF trees, 561 soil descriptions were made in the field. An additional 111 points were added by case-based reasoning using aerial photo interpretation. As RF makes classification decisions from the mode of many independently grown trees, model uncertainty can be derived. The overall out of the bag (OOB) error was lower without weighting of classes; weighting increased the overall OOB error and the resulting output did not reflect soil-landscape relationships observed in the field. The final RF model had an OOB error of 55.2% and predicted soils on landforms consistent with soil-landscape relationships. The OOB error for individual classes typically decreased with increasing class size. In addition to the final classification, I determined the second and third most likely classification, model confidence, and the hypothetical extent of individual classes. Pixels that had high possibility of belonging to multiple soil classes were aggregated using a minimum confidence value based on limiting soil features, which is an effective and objective method of determining membership in soil map unit associations and complexes mapped at the 1:24,000 scale. Variables derived from both DEM and Landsat 7 ETM+ sources were important for predicting soil classes based on Gini and standard measures of variable importance and OOB errors from groves grown with exclusively DEM- or Landsat-derived data. Random forests was a powerful predictor of soil classes and produced outputs that facilitated further understanding of soil-landscape relationships.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Selection of training samples for updating conventional soil map based on spatial neighborhood analysis of environmental covariates</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Gao2020</b:Tag>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Selection of training samples plays an important role in updating conventional soil maps with data mining models. In this paper, we developed a method to determine spatial locations of training samples based on spatial neighborhood analysis of environmental covariates for each soil polygon. Training samples were selected based on a single environmental variable or integrated variables generated using multiple variables. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to test the effect of different spatial neighborhood sizes and selected sample numbers on soil mapping accuracy. Random selection of training samples from soil polygons and soil types respectively were applied to compare with the proposed method in a study area in Raffelson watershed in La Crosse, Wisconsin of USA. Random forest was adopted as the soil prediction model. Results showed that training samples selected using single variables such as Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), slope, plan curvature, profile curvature or slope length factor with the proposed method improved the overall mapping accuracies compared with the conventional soil map, of which using TWI achieved the highest improvement of 27%. The proposed method using TWI, slope or slope length factor performed better than random selection strategies. Random selection from soil polygons generated higher overall mapping accuracies than from soil types. It was concluded that using composite environmental variables which could represent the soil forming environment of a study area well is recommended when applying the proposed method. The proposed method is not sensitive to the selected sample number, but an appropriate neighborhood size is needed for using the proposed method. In our study area with small spatial coverage, neighborhood size 5 × 5 or 3 × 3 is recommended.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Publisher>Elsevier BV</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>A novel method for soil carbon auditing at farm scale based on data value is presented. Using a map of carbon content with associated uncertainty, it optimizes stratified random sampling: number of strata, stratum boundaries, total sample size and sample sizes within strata. The optimization maximizes the expected profit for the farmer on the basis of sequestered carbon price, sampling costs, and a trading parameter that balances farmer's and buyer's risks due to uncertainty of the estimated amount of sequestered carbon. The stratification is optimized by a novel method (Ospats), an iterative procedure that re-allocates grid points to strata on the basis of pairwise differences between predictions and covariances of prediction errors. Optimal sample sizes are calculated from variance predictions by Ospats. An application on an Australian farm has shown that soil carbon changes across farms and regions can be audited effectively using the proposed method. It is concluded that sample bulking and returning to the same sites in subsequent sampling rounds are not recommendable.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Machine learning and soil sciences: a review aided by machine learning tools</b:Title>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>The application of machine learning (ML) techniques in various fields of science has increased rapidly, especially in the last 10 years. The increasing availability of soil data that can be efficiently acquired remotely and proximally, and freely available open-source algorithms, have led to an accelerated adoption of ML techniques to analyse soil data. Given the large number of publications, it is an impossible task to manually review all papers on the application of ML in soil science without narrowing down a narrative of ML application in a specific research question. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the application of ML techniques in soil science aided by a ML algorithm (latent Dirichlet allocation) to find patterns in a large collection of text corpora. The objective is to gain insight into publications of ML applications in soil science and to discuss the research gaps in this topic. We found that (a) there is an increasing usage of ML methods in soil sciences, mostly concentrated in developed countries, (b) the reviewed publications can be grouped into 12 topics, namely remote sensing, soil organic carbon, water, contamination, methods (ensembles), erosion and parent material, methods (NN, neural networks, SVM, support vector machines), spectroscopy, modelling (classes), crops, physical, and modelling (continuous), and (c) advanced ML methods usually perform better than simpler approaches thanks to their capability to capture non-linear relationships. From these findings, we found research gaps, in particular, about the precautions that should be taken (parsimony) to avoid overfitting, and that the interpretability of the ML models is an important aspect to consider when applying advanced ML methods in order to improve our knowledge and understanding of soil. We foresee that a large number of studies will focus on the latter topic.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Digital soil mapping and assessment for Australia and beyond: A propitious future</b:Title>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Digital Soil Mapping and Assessment (DSMA) has progressed from challenging traditional soil science paradigms, through small scale prototyping, to large-scale implementation capturing quantitative measures of soil attributes and functions. This paper considers the future for DSMA in the context of a highly uncertain world where high-quality knowledge of soil dynamics will be important for responding to the challenges of sustainability. Irrespective of whether the need is for survival, increased productivity or broadening the services provided from land management, or simply securing the soil itself, we see DSMA as a fundamental approach and essential tool. With a broadening need and a strong foundation in the practice of DSMA now in place, the theory, tools and technology of DSMA will grow significantly. We explore expected changes in covariate data, the modelling process, the nature of base data generation and product delivery that will lead to tracking and forecasting a much wider range of soil attributes and functions at finer spatial and temporal resolutions over larger areas, particularly globally. Equally importantly, we expect the application and impact of DSMA to broaden and be used, directly and collaterally, in the analysis of land management issues in coming decades. It has the capacity to provide the background to a soil and landscape ‘digital twin’ and the consequent transformation in monitoring and forecasting the impacts of land management practices. We envision the continued growth of DSMA skills amongst soil scientists and a much broader community of practice involved in developing and utilizing DSMA products and tools. Consequently, there will be a widening and deepening role of public-private partnerships in this development and application.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Sentinel-2 image capacities to predict common topsoil properties of temperate and Mediterranean agroecosystems</b:Title>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>To be fully operational for facilitating decisions made at any spatial level, models and indicators of soil ecosystem functions require the use of precise spatially referenced soil information as inputs. This study aimed at exploring the capacity for Sentinel-2A (S2A) multispectral satellite images to predict several topsoil properties in two contrasted pedoclimatic environments: a temperate region marked by intensive annual crop cultivation patterns and soils derived from loess or colluvium and/or marine limestone or chalk (Versailles Plain, 221 km2); and a Mediterranean region marked by vineyard cultivation and soils derived from lacustrine limestone, calcareous sandstones, colluvium, or alluvial deposits (Peyne catchment, 48 km2). Prediction models of soil properties based on partial least squares regressions (PLSR) were built from S2A spectra of 72 and 143 sampling locations across the Versailles Plain and Peyne catchment, respectively. Eight soil surface properties were investigated in both regions: pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), texture fractions (Clay, Silt, Sand), Iron, Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3) and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) content. Predictive abilities were studied according to the root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) tests, cross-validated coefficient of determination (R2cv) and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). Intermediate prediction performance outcomes (R2cv and RPD greater than or equal to 0.5 and 1.4, respectively) were obtained for 4 topsoil properties found across the Versailles Plain (SOC, pH, CaCO3 and CEC), and near-intermediate performance outcomes (0.5 &gt; R2cv &gt; 0.39, 1.4 &gt; RPD &gt; 1.3) were yielded for 3 topsoil properties (Clay, Iron, and CEC) found across the Peyne catchment and for 1 property (Clay) found across the Versailles Plain. The study results show what can be expected from Sentinel-2 images in terms of predictive capacities at the regional scale. The spatial structure of the estimated soil properties for bare soils pixels is highlighted, promising further improvements made to spatial prediction models for these properties based on the use of Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) techniques.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>It has long been acknowledged that the soil spatial samplings used as inputs to DSM models are strong drivers – and often limiting factors – of the performances of such models. However, few studies have focused on evaluating this impact and identifying the related spatial sampling characteristics. In this study, a numerical experiment was conducted on this topic using the pseudo values of topsoil clay content obtained from an airborne Visible Near InfraRed-Short Wave InfraRed (Vis-NIR-SWIR) hyperspectral image in the Cap Bon region (Tunisia) as the source of the spatial sampling.

Twelve thousand DSM models were built by running a Random Forest algorithm from soil spatial sampling of different sizes and average spacings (from 200 m to 2000 m) and different spatial distributions (from clustered to regularly distributed), aiming to mimic the various situations encountered when handling legacy data. These DSM models were evaluated with regard to both their prediction performances and their ability to estimate their overall and local uncertainties. Three evaluation methods were applied: a model-based one, a classical model-free one using 25% of the sites removed from the initial soil data, and a reference one using a set of 100,000 independent sites selected by stratified random sampling over the entire region.

The results showed that: 1) While, as expected, the performances of the DSM models increased when the spacing of the sample increased, this increase was diminished for the smallest spacing as soon as 50% of the spatially structured variance was captured by the sampling, 2) Sampling that provided complete and even distributions in the geographical space and had as great spread of the target soil property as possible increased the DSM performances, while complete and even sampling distributions in the covariate space had less impacts, 3) Systematic underestimations of the overall uncertainty of DSM models were observed, that were all the more important that the sparse samplings poorly covered the real distribution of the target soil property and that the dense sampling were unevenly distributed in the geographical space, 4) The local uncertainties were underestimated for sparse sampling and over-estimated for dense sampling while being sensitive to the same sampling characteristics as overall uncertainty.

Such finding have practical outcomes on sampling strategies and DSM model evaluation that are discussed.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Predicting the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon stock in Swedish forests using a group of covariates and site-specific data</b:Title>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>The status of the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock at any position in the landscape is subject to a complex interplay of soil state factors operating at different scales and regulating multiple processes resulting either in soils acting as a net sink or net source of carbon. Forest landscapes are characterized by high spatial variability, and key drivers of SOC stock might be specific for sub-areas compared to those influencing the whole landscape. Consequently, separately calibrating models for sub-areas (local models) that collectively cover a target area can result in different prediction accuracy and SOC stock drivers compared to a single model (global model) that covers the whole area. The goal of this study was therefore to (1) assess how global and local models differ in predicting the humus layer, mineral soil, and total SOC stock in Swedish forests and (2) identify the key factors for SOC stock prediction and their scale of influence.

We used the Swedish National Forest Soil Inventory (NFSI) database and a digital soil mapping approach to evaluate the prediction performance using random forest models calibrated locally for the northern, central, and southern Sweden (local models) and for the whole of Sweden (global model). Models were built by considering (1) only site characteristics which are recorded on the plot during the NFSI, (2) the group of covariates (remote sensing, historical land use data, etc.) and (3) both site characteristics and group of covariates consisting mostly of remote sensing data.

Local models were generally more effective for predicting SOC stock after testing on independent validation data. Using the group of covariates together with NFSI data indicated that such covariates have limited predictive strength but that site-specific covariates from the NFSI showed better explanatory strength for SOC stocks. The most important covariates that influence the humus layer, mineral soil (0–50 cm), and total SOC stock were related to the site-characteristic covariates and include the soil moisture class, vegetation type, soil type, and soil texture. This study showed that local calibration has the potential to improve prediction accuracy, which will vary depending on the type of available covariates.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Tag>Minasny2006</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>Elsevier</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Prediction of soil attributes (properties and classes) in digital soil mapping (DSM) is based on the correlation between primary soil attributes and secondary environmental attributes. These secondary attributes can be obtained relatively cheaply over large areas. In the presence of these environmental covariates, a strategic sampling design needs to ensure the coverage of the full range of environmental variables. This could enhance the full representation of the expected soil properties or soil classes. This chapter presents the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) as a sampling strategy on existing data layers. LHS is a stratified-random procedure that provides an efficient way of sampling variables from their multivariate distributions. It provides a full coverage of the range of each variable by maximally stratifying the marginal distribution. This method is illustrated with examples from DSM of part of the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. Comparison is made with other methods: random sampling, equal spatial strata and principal component (PC). Results showed that the LHS is the most effective way to replicate the distribution of the variables.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Sampling Strategies for Soil Property Mapping Using Multispectral Sentinel-2 and Hyperspectral EnMAP Satellite Data</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Castaldi2019</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>MDPI AG</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Designing a sampling strategy for soil property mapping from remote sensing imagery entails making decisions about sampling pattern and number of samples. A consistent number of ancillary data strongly related to the target variable allows applying a sampling strategy that optimally covers the feature space. This study aims at evaluating the capability of multispectral (Sentinel-2) and hyperspectral (EnMAP) satellite data to select the sampling locations in order to collect a calibration dataset for multivariate statistical modelling of the Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) content in the topsoil of croplands. We tested different sampling strategies based on the feature space, where the ancillary data are the spectral bands of the Sentinel-2 and of simulated EnMAP satellite data acquired in Demmin (north-east Germany). Some selection algorithms require setting the number of samples in advance (random, Kennard-Stones and conditioned Latin Hypercube algorithms) where others automatically provide the ideal number of samples (Puchwein, SELECT and Puchwein+SELECT algorithm). The SOC content and the spectra extracted at the sampling locations were used to build random forest (RF) models. We evaluated the accuracy of the RF estimation models on an independent dataset. The lowest Sentinel-2 normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) for the validation set was obtained using Puchwein (nRMSE: 8.7%), and Kennard-Stones (9.2%) algorithms. The most efficient sampling strategies, expressed as the ratio between accuracy and number of samples per hectare, were obtained using Puchwein with EnMAP and Puchwein+SELECT algorithm with Sentinel-2 data. Hence, Sentinel-2 and EnMAP data can be exploited to build a reliable calibration dataset for SOC mapping. For EnMAP, the different selection algorithms provided very similar results. On the other hand, using Puchwein and Kennard-Stones algorithms, Sentinel-2 provided a more accurate estimation than the EnMAP. The calibration datasets provided by EnMAP data provided lower SOC variability and lower prediction accuracy compared to Sentinel-2. This was probably due to EnMAP coarser spatial resolution (30 m) less adequate for linkage to the sampling performed at 10 m scale.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>A multifunctional matching algorithm for sample design in agricultural plots</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>OhanaLevi2021</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>Elsevier BV</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Collection of accurate and representative data from agricultural fields is required for efficient crop management. Since growers have limited available resources, there is a need for advanced methods to select representative points within a field in order to best satisfy sampling or sensing objectives. The main purpose of this work was to develop a data-driven method for selecting locations across an agricultural field given observations of some covariates at every point in the field. These chosen locations should be representative of the distribution of the covariates in the entire population and represent the spatial variability in the field. They can then be used to sample an unknown target feature whose sampling is expensive and cannot be realistically done at the population scale.

An algorithm for determining these optimal sampling locations, namely the multifunctional matching (MFM) criterion, was based on matching of moments (functionals) between sample and population. The selected functionals in this study were standard deviation, mean, and Kendall’s tau. An additional algorithm defined the minimal number of observations that could represent the population according to a desired level of accuracy. The MFM was applied to datasets from two agricultural plots: a vineyard and a peach orchard. The data from the plots included measured values of slope, topographic wetness index, normalized difference vegetation index, and apparent soil electrical conductivity. The MFM algorithm selected the number of sampling points according to a representation accuracy of 90% and determined the optimal location of these points. The algorithm was validated against values of vine or tree water status measured as crop water stress index (CWSI). Algorithm performance was then compared to two other sampling methods: the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) model and a uniform random sample with spatial constraints. Comparison among sampling methods was based on measures of similarity between the target variable population distribution and the distribution of the selected sample.

MFM represented CWSI distribution better than the cLHS and the uniform random sampling, and the selected locations showed smaller deviations from the mean and standard deviation of the entire population. The MFM functioned better in the vineyard, where spatial variability was larger than in the orchard. In both plots, the spatial pattern of the selected samples captured the spatial variability of CWSI. MFM can be adjusted and applied using other moments/functionals and may be adopted by other disciplines, particularly in cases where small sample sizes are desired.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Digital soil mapping, downscaling andupdating conventional soil maps using GIS,RS, Statistics and auxiliary data</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Zeraatpisheh2017a</b:Tag>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Spatial distribution of soil types and soil properties in the landscape are important in many environmental researches. Conventional soil surveys are not designed to provide the high-resolution soil information required in environmental modelling and site-specific farm management. The objectives of this study were to investigate the relationship between soil development, soil evolution in the landscape, updating legacy soil maps and pedodiversity in an arid and semi-arid region. The application of Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) techniques was investigated with a particular focus to predict soil taxonomic classes and spatial distribution of soil types by soil observations and covariate sets representative of s,c,o,r,p,a,n factors. In the first study, focus is on establishing relationships between pedodiversity and landform evolution in a 86,000 ha region in Borujen, Chaharmahal-Va-Bakhtiari Province, Central Iran. From an overview study, we could conclude that landform evolution was mainly affected by topography and its components. A second study compares various DSM-methods and a conventional soil mapping approach for soil class maps in terms of accuracy, information value and cost in central Iran. Also, the effects of different sample sizes were investigated. Our results demonstrated that in most predicted maps, in DSM approaches, the best results were obtained using the combination of terrain attributes and the geomorphology map. Furthermore, results showed that the conventional soil mapping approach was not as effective as DSM approach. In the third study, different models of the DSM approach were compared to predict the spatial distribution of some important soil properties such as clay content, soil organic carbon and calcium carbonate content. Among all studied models, the terrain attribute “elevation” is the most important variable to predict soil properties. Random forest had promising performance to predict soil organic carbon. But results revealed that all models could not predict the spatial distributions of clay content properly. The minimum area of land that can be legibly delineated in a traditional (printed) map is highly dependent upon mapping scale. For example, this area at a mapping scale of 1:24,000 is about 2.3 ha but at a mapping scale of 1:1,000,000 it is about 1000 ha. A mapping scale of 1:1,000,000 is just too coarse to show a fine-scale pattern or soil type with any degree of legibility, but finer-scale soil maps are more expensive and time-consuming to produce. Thus, spatial variation is often unavoidably obscured. The fourth study of this dissertation focuses on downscaling and updating soil map methods. Thus, the objectives were to apply supervised and unsupervised disaggregation approaches to disaggregate soil polygons of conventional soil map at a scale of 1: 1,000,000 in the selected area. Therefore, soil subgroups and great groups were selected because it is a basic taxonomic level in regional and national soil maps in Iran. In general, we conclude that DSM approach and also disaggregation approach are capable to predict soil types and properties, produce and update legacy soil maps. However, still a number of challenges need to be evaluated e.g. influence of expert knowledge on CSM approach, resolution of ancillary data, georeferenced legacy soil samples data to validate disaggregated soil maps.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Soils of semi-arid climates undergo organic carbon loss, which in turn affects their agricultural potential. Geostatistics is often used as an interpolation tool to thoroughly describe SOC spatial distribution. To focus on soil organic carbon (SOC) depletion, the Tiffech watershed (Northeast of Algeria), an economically important agricultural area, was chosen due to intensive agricultural practices, decline of forests and occurrence of erosion. The present study aimed to predict the spatial variation of SOC in Tiffech watershed using geostatistics and a Geographical Information System (GIS) software, comparing the performance of two geostatistical methods—Ordinary Kriging (OK) and Regression Kriging (RK)—also assessing the role of auxiliary variables in improving the prediction accuracy and highlighting the role of land cover in SOC storage. The SOC content in Tiffech soils was determined on 42 soil samples from the surface layer (0–10 cm) collected all over the study area and the results were used to estimate SOC density in non-sampled locations. The prediction efficiency of the two methods was evaluated by calculating the Mean Error (ME), the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Root Mean Square Standardized Error (RMSSE). The interpolation results showed that SOC distribution in the study area was correlated to the topography, the clay index, and general landscape features. SOC content increased northwards in the area, ranging from 0.53 to 6.9 kg·m−2 in relation to land use. As expected, maps figured a good conservation status of SOC stocks in areas with dense vegetation; conversely poor SOC contents were estimated where land degradation factors take place. Cross-validation results showed an outperformance in the interpolation accuracy of RK on OK after the introduction of environmental variables, with an RMSE value of 0.02 versus 0.81. This suggests a higher efficiency of RK in predicting SOC content across the Tiffech area in comparison with OK, confirming that introducing some auxiliary data correlated to the target variable in SOC estimation, considerably improved the interpolation accuracy.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Do more detailed environmental covariates deliver more accurate soil maps?</b:Title>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>In this study we evaluated whether investing in more spatially detailed environmental covariates improves the accuracy of digital soil maps. We used a case study from Southern Brazil to map clay content (CLAY), organic carbon content (SOC), and effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) of the topsoil for a   2000 ha area located on the edge of the plateau of the Paraná Sedimentary Basin. Five covariates, each with two levels of spatial detail were used: area-class soil maps, digital elevation models (DEM), geologic maps, land use maps, and satellite images. Thirty-two multiple linear regression models were calibrated for each soil property using all spatial detail combinations of the covariates. For each combination, stepwise regression was used to select predictor variables incorporated in the model. Model evaluation was done using the adjusted R-square of the regression. The baseline model, calibrated with the less detailed version of each covariate, and the best performing model were used to calibrate two linear mixed models for each soil property. Model parameters were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood. Spatial prediction was performed using the empirical best linear unbiased predictor. Validation of baseline and best performing linear multiple regression and linear mixed models was done using cross-validation. Results show that for CLAY the prediction accuracy did not considerably improve by using more detailed covariates. The amount of variance explained increased only   2 percentage points (pp), less than that obtained by including the kriging step, which explained 4 pp. On the other hand, prediction of SOC and ECEC improved by   13 pp when the baseline model was replaced by the best performing model. Overall, the increase in prediction performance was modest and may not outweigh the extra costs of using more detailed covariates. It may be more efficient to spend extra resources on collecting more soil observations, or increasing the detail of only those covariates that have the strongest improvement effect. In our case study, the latter would only work for SOC and ECEC, by investing in a more detailed land use map and possibly also a more detailed geologic map and DEM.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>This study aimed to map SOC lateral, and vertical variations down to 1 m depth in a semi-arid region in Kurdistan Province, Iran. Six data mining techniques namely; artificial neural networks, support vector regression, k-nearest neighbor, random forests, regression tree models, and genetic programming were combined with equal-area smoothing splines to develop, evaluate and compare their effectiveness in achieving this aim. Using the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling method, 188 soil profiles in the study area were sampled and soil organic carbon content (SOC) measured. Eighteen ancillary data variables derived from a digital elevation model and Landsat 8 images were used to represent predictive soil forming factors in this study area. Findings showed that normalized difference vegetation index and wetness index were the most useful ancillary data for SOC mapping in the upper (0–15 cm) and bottom (60–100 cm) of soil profiles, respectively. According to 5-fold cross-validation, artificial neural networks (ANN) showed the highest performance for prediction of SOC in the four standard depths compared to all other data mining techniques. ANNs resulted in the lowest root mean square error and highest Lin's concordance coefficient which ranged from 0.07 to 0.20 log (kg/m3) and 0.68 to 0.41, respectively, with the first value in each range being for the top of the profile and second for the bottom. Furthermore, ANNs increased performance of spatial prediction compared to the other data mining algorithms by up to 36, 23, 21 and 13% for each soil depth, respectively, starting from the top of the profile. Overall, results showed that prediction of subsurface SOC variation needs improvement and the challenge remains to find appropriate covariates that can explain it.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>A conditioned Latin hypercube sampling algorithm incorporating operational constraints</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>inbook</b:Tag>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>The conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) method is a popular sampling allocation method within the digital soil mapping community, and allows soil practitioners to make use of existing information to produce an optimized sampling stratification. However, it often produces sampling schemes that are scattered around the landscape, resulting in plans that are costly to implement. This paper proposes to enhance the cLHS method by incorporating operational constraints into it, so that the output can be implemented in a cost-effective fashion. The cost of reaching each point in the landscape from the road network has been assessed using terrain and landcover attributes. This cost layer has then been used in the optimisation process of the cLHS algorithm to penalise the points that are difficult or impossible to reach in the field, and guide the sampling process towards schemes that are easier to implement operationaly. Results are illustrated using a real example in New Zealand.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Assessing soil carbon stocks under pastures through orbital remote sensing</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Szakacs2011</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>FapUNIFESP (SciELO)</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>The growing demand of world food and energy supply increases the threat of global warming due to higher greenhouse gas emissions by agricultural activity. Therefore, it is widely admitted that agriculture must establish a new paradigm in terms of environmental sustainability that incorporate techniques for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. This article addresses to the scientific demand to estimate in a fast and inexpensive manner current and potential soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in degraded pastures, using remote sensing techniques. Four pastures on sandy soils under Brazilian Cerrado vegetation in São Paulo state were chosen due to their SOC sequestration potential, which was characterized for the soil depth 0-50 cm. Subsequently, a linear regression analysis was performed between SOC and Leaf Area Index (LAI) measured in the field (LAIfield) and derived by satellite (LAIsatellite) as well as SOC and pasture reflectance in six spectra from 450 nm - 2350 nm, using the Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) sensor of satellite Landsat 7. A high correlation between SOC and LAIfield (R2 = 0.9804) and LAIsatellite (R2 = 0.9812) was verified. The suitability of satellite derived LAI for SOC determination leads to the assumption, that orbital remote sensing is a very promising SOC estimation technique from regional to global scale.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Use of Sentinel-2 Time-Series Images for Classification and Uncertainty Analysis of Inherent Biophysical Property: Case of Soil Texture Mapping</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Gomez2019</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>MDPI AG</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>The Sentinel-2 mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus program provides multispectral remote sensing data at decametric spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. The objective of this work is to evaluate the ability of Sentinel-2 time-series data to enable classification of an inherent biophysical property, in terms of accuracy and uncertainty estimation. The tested inherent biophysical property was the soil texture. Soil texture classification was performed on each individual Sentinel-2 image with a linear support vector machine. Two sources of uncertainty were studied: uncertainties due to the Sentinel-2 acquisition date and uncertainties due to the soil sample selection in the training dataset. The first uncertainty analysis was achieved by analyzing the diversity of classification results obtained from the time series of soil texture classifications, considering that the temporal resolution is akin to a repetition of spectral measurements. The second uncertainty analysis was achieved from each individual Sentinel-2 image, based on a bootstrapping procedure corresponding to 100 independent classifications obtained with different training data. The Simpson index was used to compute this diversity in the classification results. This work was carried out in an Indian cultivated region (84 km2, part of Berambadi catchment, in the Karnataka state). It used a time-series of six Sentinel-2 images acquired from February to April 2017 and 130 soil surface samples, collected over the study area and characterized in terms of texture. The classification analysis showed the following: (i) each single-date image analysis resulted in moderate performances for soil texture classification, and (ii) high confusion was obtained between neighboring textural classes, and low confusion was obtained between remote textural classes. The uncertainty analysis showed that (i) the classification of remote textural classes (clay and sandy loam) was more certain than classifications of intermediate classes (sandy clay and sandy clay loam), (ii) a final soil textural map can be produced depending on the allowed uncertainty, and iii) a higher level of allowed uncertainty leads to increased bare soil coverage. These results illustrate the potential of Sentinel-2 for providing input for modeling environmental processes and crop management.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>The goal of the Water Smart Agriculture (WSA) program is to improve food security in Central America through changes in policies, programs, and practices in water use efficiency. The Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) project is a component of WSA that aims to create human capital with knowledge and skills in sustainable soil and water management through the production of informative soil maps, under the guiding principle of “managing soils to manage water”. DSM provides a platform for producing detailed maps of soil types, properties and functions. However, the transition of DSM from research to operational levels brings a new set of challenges related to input, data processing and outputs. The major challenges identified during the pilot stage of the DSM project were: (i) soil data availability, quality and compatibility; (ii) lack of DSM skills; and (iii) lack of product delivery platforms. Training based on pilot projects was conducted to build local DSM capacity and infrastructure and incorporate tacit knowledge. Expanding from pilot stage to national level required the establishment of DSM teams that are multi-institutional and interdisciplinary. In order to achieve buy-in from the local and national governments, the DSM teams were comprised of members from public institutions and professional organizations and they adopted a participatory DSM approach and produced functional soil maps capable of supporting decisions at multiple levels.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>A graded proportion method of training sample selection for updating conventional soil maps</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Liu2020</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>Elsevier BV</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Selection of training samples is a vital step in updating conventional soil maps when utilizing data mining models. Quality of training samples significantly affects the mapping results and accuracies of the updated soil maps. The area-weighted proportion method was a common method for generating training samples. However, this method usually assigns too small weight to those soil types of small areas and large weight to those of large areas in sample size allocation, which causes the unreasonable proportions of sample numbers for soil types and thereby biases the representation of soil-environmental relationships for those soil types. Meanwhile, random selection of training samples from a soil type may generate some ‘noise’ samples located in the transition areas between soil types. These two aspects in training sample selection could probably reduce the accuracy of the updated soil maps. In this study, a new method was developed to select training samples based on soil type grading according to their area coverages. The method consists of two steps. The first step is to determine the numbers of training samples for each soil type based on soil type grading so as to maintain the reasonable proportion in sample numbers among soil types with different area coverages. The second step is to select typical (representative) samples for each soil type from conventional soil map, to avoid generation of ‘noise samples’. To evaluate the proposed method, the method was compared with three other training sample selection methods with four training sample sizes. Each method was ran for 100 times to generate training sample datasets with each sample size to evaluate their effectiveness and stability. Random forest was employed to generate updated soil maps in a small watershed in Raffelson, Wisconsin (USA). The validation results showed that the graded proportion method effectively solved the imbalanced issue of training samples among soil types with area coverages in big differences caused by the area-weighted proportion strategy. Thus training samples generated using the proposed method usually obtained more accurate and reasonable mapping results than those using the area-weighted proportion strategy. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method was more stable than that of the area-weighted proportion strategy with the training sample size increasing. It is concluded that the proposed method is an effective training sample selection method for data mining model to update conventional soil maps.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Mapping the soils of an Argentine Pampas region using structural equation modelling</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Angelini2016</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>Elsevier BV</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Current digital soil mapping (DSM) methods have limitations. For instance, it is difficult to predict a large number of soil properties simultaneously, while preserving the relationships between them. Another problem is that prevalent prediction models use pedological knowledge in a very crude way only. To tackle these problems, we investigated the use of structural equation modelling (SEM). SEM has its roots in the social sciences and is recently also being used in other scientific disciplines, such as ecology. SEM integrates empirical information with mechanistic knowledge by deriving the model equations from known causal relationships, while estimating the model parameters using the available data. It distinguishes between endogenous and exogenous variables, where, in our application, the first are soil properties and the latter are external soil forming factors (i.e. climate, relief, organisms). We introduce SEM theory and present a case study in which we applied SEM to a 22,900 km 2 region in the Argentinian Pampas to map seven key soil properties. In this case study, we started with identifying the main soil forming processes in the study area and assigned for each process the main soil properties affected. Based on this analysis we defined a conceptual soil-landscape model, which was subsequently converted to a SEM graphical model. Finally, we derived the SEM equations and implemented these in the statistical software R using the latent variable analysis (lavaan) package. The model was calibrated using a soil dataset of 320 soil profile data and 12 environmental covariate layers. The outcomes of the model were maps of seven soil properties and a SEM graph that shows the strength of the relationships. Although the accuracy of the maps, based on cross-validation and independent validation, was poor, this paper demonstrates that SEM can be used to explicitly include pedological knowledge in prediction of soil properties and modelling of their interrelationships. It bridges the gap between empirical and mechanistic methods for soil-landscape modelling, and is a tool that can help produce pedologically sound soil maps.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>The current soil mapping produced by CIREN, covers a part of the current needs of the country related to soils of agricultural and forestry aptitude; at detail scales, however, there is a lack of soil studies and associated mapping related to such particular ecosystems as highland soils, wetland water soils, high mountain soils, soils of remote regions and island territories, both in detail and in thematic recognition and mapping. It is understood that this involves a high cost for field activities, however, digital soil mapping is able to cover a series of aspects related to the extension and spatial distribution of soils as predictive models for the growing demand in ecological and environmental aspects. Through the SCORPAN model, it is possible to generate a cartography that represents soil classes and thematic properties. Pedotransfer functions allow to estimate unknown variables through known soil properties, fitting to regression models. The capture of terrain morphological records together with soil samples that analyze physical, chemical and biological properties allow the use of these records as training data to validate the transfer functions.

This trial seeks to reflect the importance of applying digital soil mapping models in Chile for better resource management.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Selecting appropriate machine learning methods for digital soil mapping</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Khaledian2020</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>Elsevier BV</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Digital soil mapping (DSM) increasingly makes use of machine learning algorithms to identify relationships between soil properties and multiple covariates that can be detected across landscapes. Selecting the appropriate algorithm for model building is critical for optimizing results in the context of the available data. Over the past decade, many studies have tested different machine learning (ML) approaches on a variety of soil data sets. Here, we review the application of some of the most popular ML algorithms for digital soil mapping. Specifically, we compare the strengths and weaknesses of multiple linear regression (MLR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), Cubist, random forest (RF), and artificial neural networks (ANN) for DSM. These algorithms were compared on the basis of five factors: (1) quantity of hyperparameters, (2) sample size, (3) covariate selection, (4) learning time, and (5) interpretability of the resulting model. If training time is a limitation, then algorithms that have fewer model parameters and hyperparameters should be considered, e.g., MLR, KNN, SVR, and Cubist. If the data set is large (thousands of samples) and computation time is not an issue, ANN would likely produce the best results. If the data set is small (&lt;100), then Cubist, KNN, RF, and SVR are likely to perform better than ANN and MLR. The uncertainty in predictions produced by Cubist, KNN, RF, and SVR may not decrease with large datasets. When interpretability of the resulting model is important to the user, Cubist, MLR, and RF are more appropriate algorithms as they do not function as “black boxes.” There is no one correct approach to produce models for predicting the spatial distribution of soil properties. Nonetheless, some algorithms are more appropriate than others considering the nature of the data and purpose of mapping activity.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Evaluation of conditioned Latin hypercube sampling for soil mapping based on a machine learning method</b:Title>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Abstract Sampling design plays an important role in soil survey and soil mapping. Conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) has been proven as an efficient sampling strategy and used widely in digital soil mapping. cLHS samples are randomly selected in each stratum of environmental variables, thus the produced sample sets can vary significantly at different runs with the same sample size. Although variation of mapping accuracies caused by the randomness of cLHS has been realized and qualitatively mentioned in past studies. However, how the randomness of cLHS could quantitatively influence mapping accuracy has rarely been examined. In this study, we conducted experiments to examine how the sample randomness quantitatively influence soil mapping accuracy with different sample sizes, and analyzed the possible reasons from a pedogenesis perspective. The results showed that the largest range of mapping accuracies of 500 repeats was 39.5% at a sample density of 2.59 point/km2, while the smallest range was 7.3% at the maximum sample size with a sample density of 32.47 point/km2. The sample density for satisfactory prediction accuracies in our study area was at least 10.06 Point/km2. The results showed that both the allocation of sample points to each soil series and the typicality of sample points played important roles in mapping accuracies. But the deep reasons causing the unstable performance of cLHS at small sample sizes were the imbalanced class distribution of soil series and the overlap between soil series in the distribution of environmental covariates. Researchers need to be cautious about the output when applying cLHS with small sampling densities. Some effective approaches to address this issue include increasing the sample size, checking the sample allocations of a cLHS design with the assistance of legacy soil maps, or adding the legacy soil map as a variable during sampling design. When the sampling resources and legacy soil maps are limited for an area, fuzzy k-means clustering sampling could be a potential alternative. This study provides useful references for better understanding the uncertainty of cLHS when the sample density is small and selecting alternative sampling methods accordingly.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Predicting regional spatial distribution of soil texture in floodplains using remote sensing data: A case of southeastern Iran</b:Title>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Soil texture is a physical property of soil and knowledge on its spatial distribution is essential for many agricultural and environmental activities especially in alluvial plains. This study aimed to predict the spatial distribution of soil fractions (i.e. percentages of sand, silt, and clay) in Sistan floodplain on a regional scale (area: 1500 km2). Random forest (RF), regression kriging-neural network residual kriging (RKNNRK), neural network residual kriging (NNRK), regression kriging (RK), and cokriging (COK) methods were used to map soil texture components over the region. Soil fractions were measured for 160 soil samples taken from the surface layer (0–30 cm) of various soil series in agriculture land of Sistan floodplain. The additive log-ratio (alr) transformation was applied to transform texture components prior to prediction. Remote sensing data including Landsat 8′ Bands (1–8), Band 4 to Band 8 ratio, Band 4 to Band 3 ratio, NDVI, GSI, Brightness Index, and Clay Index were used as auxiliary variables for interpolation of soil fractions. 80% of actual data was used for prediction and 20% of data was used for validation. The performance of methods used was evaluated using RMSE, ME and MAE criteria. The results showed that the RKNNRK model has the highest accuracy for prediction of sand (RMSE = 15.04%) and clay (RMSE = 8.77%) contents while the most accurate model for predicting silt content is NNRK (RMSE = 12.68%). RK and COK performed worse than NNRK and RKNNRK. A relatively high value of RMSE obtained for sand (17.89%), silt (14.15%), and clay (8.89%) contents by the RF model. This could be due to the low relief of study area, regional scale effects, low density of sampling points and high heterogeneity of soil texture components in floodplains. Our findings revealed that RKNNRK and NNRK models, when combined with remote sensing data, produce more accurate results and therefore can be used for appropriate mapping of soil fractions in floodplains and on a regional scale.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Digital soil mapping based on wavelet decomposed components of environmental covariates</b:Title>

        <b:Publisher>Elsevier BV</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Multi-scale soil variations are increasingly employed to improve the accuracy for digital soil mapping (DSM). In this study, we attempted to explore a methodology of wavelet analysis on this topic. The terrain attributes of a study area were decomposed using the wavelet analysis, and the resulted components were applied to map soil organic carbon (SOC) content, pH and clay content using multiple linear regression (MLR) and regression kriging (RK). The results showed that the wavelet components strengthened soil-landscape relationships in terms of correlation coefficients, enhanced soil-landscape modelling in terms of MLR modelling coefficients of determination (R2). Compared with several standard DSM approaches, i.e., ordinary kriging (OK), MLR and RK with the original terrain attributes, the use of wavelet components improved the prediction accuracy at some scales, but not all the scales. Most of the improvements were at the slight to moderate levels, e.g., 3.66–14.24% increases in the accuracy based on mean error, mean absolute error, root mean square error and R2. Maps made with wavelet components were relatively smooth and sometimes contained hotspots due to characteristics of wavelet components, which differed a lot from those made by the standard DSM methods. The potential benefits of using wavelet components as predictors in DSM may be further revealed in the future when more predictor selection approaches and mapping methods are considered.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Assessing spatial variability in soil characteristics with geographically weighted principal components analysis</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Kumar2012</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>Springer Science and Business Media LLC</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Dimensionality reduction methods such as principal components analysis (PCA) provide a means of identifying trends in soil characteristics which may be represented by a wide range of variables. However, these characteristics may be highly spatially variable and so the results from PCA represent, in some sense, an “average” of locally distinct characteristics. One approach to account for these local differences is to introduce a geographical weighting scheme into the PCA process. In this paper, such an approach is assessed in the exploration of soil characteristics in the state of Pennsylvania, USA. Data from 878 georeferenced soil profiles which include different soil parameters (n = 12) were extracted from the National Soil Survey Center database. Where data are parts of compositions (e.g., percentages of sand, silt, and clay), analysis using raw data is not appropriate and such data were transformed using log ratios (specifically, balances). Single variables (i.e., those which are not parts of compositions) were logged. The first two principal components explain over 50% of the variance. The mapped values suggest marked spatial variation in soil characteristics, but it is not possible to assess which of these variables explain most variation in particular regions from the simple maps of raw variables. Geographically weighted PCA (GWPCA) provides additional information which is obscured by PCA, and it also provides a set of component scores and loadings at all data locations. The soil variable with the largest loading at most locations of Pennsylvania is the logged base saturation (BSln), and this supports the findings of the conventional PCA analysis. While BSln loads most highly in most of the eastern third, the middle and the south west of the state, the northwest is less spatially consistent in terms of the variables which explain most variation. For GWPC 1, the variable with the second largest loading at most locations (i.e., primarily the south and west) is CEC.B1 (the log ratio of Ca, Mg, and Na to K and EXACID), while CEC.B2 (the log ratio of Ca and Mg to Na), pHln (logged pH) and BSln dominate in other areas. The GWPCA results suggest that there is marked spatial variation in multivariate soil characteristics across Pennsylvania state and that results from standard PCA obscure this considerable variation.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Classification of fields into management zones based on variability of soil fertility parameters is under use in precision agriculture. The study was conducted in west Wollega zone of Ethiopia covering nearly 40 km2 of agricultural land, with the aim to explain variability of soils in the field, classify soils into mapping units and produce a map of these soils at a scale of 1:10000 using geostatistics. In this paper, soil mapping units (SMUs) were interchangeably used with management zones. Ten SMUs were identified in the study site. The SMU mean pH value varied between 5.3 in the SMU6 and 6.4 in the SMU7. Variation in soil texture, pH, exchangeable acidity, exchangeable potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), cation exchange capacity (CEC), organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), and plant available phosphorus (AvP), were observed within and among SMUs. Variability of soil parameters ranged from 1.06% (Na) in the SMU5 to 172.94% (AvP) in the SMU8. The OC and AvP content of all SMUs were found in the very low and low critical ranges. Intensive grid sampling had helped to produce digital soil maps and exposed soil heterogeneity across the landscape. We suggest that classification of fields into management zones was a remedy to low crop production occurred from uniform applications of nutrients and chemical amendments to significantly varying soils.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Spatial information of soil carbon storage at national and global level is essential for soil quality and environmental management. Improved knowledge on the amount and spatial distribution of the carbon stock in soils is crucial in estimating changes in the terrestrial carbon dynamics and management options for carbon-storing. A study was conducted to map the soil organic carbon stock (SOC) over 56,763 km2 area of Western Ghats of south India using a digital soil mapping approach. Landsat data, terrain attributes, and bioclimatic variables were used as covariates. Equal-area quadratic splines were fitted to soil profile datasets to estimate soil organic carbon stock at six standard soil depths (0–5, 5–15, 15–30, 30–60, 60–100 and 100–200 cm) and Quantile Regression Forest (QRF) algorithm was used to predict the SOC stocks. Prediction of SOC stock was better for surface layer (R2 = 31–43%) and the performance was decreasing with depth (R2 = 7–21%). The modal performance was also compared with SoilGrids products. Although the spatial patterns were similar, the present predicted SOC maps outperformed SoilGrids products in terms of both R2 and RMSE. The predicted total soil organic stock in the Western Ghats ranged from 7.1 kg m−2 to 30.9 kg m−2 and the total estimated SOC was 917 Tg. The present high resolution SOC maps help to assess and monitor the soil health and preparation of proper land use planning.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>El objetivo de este estudio fue evaluar el desempeño del método de muestreo denominado hipercubo latino condicionado (cLHS) para identificar sitios convenientes para la obtención de datos de propiedades edáficas, que son usados en la construcción de modelos para el mapeo digital de una variable espacialmente distribuida, como es el carbono orgánico del suelo (COS). Dados N sitios con información sobre p variables explicativas (X), cLHS selecciona una muestra de n sitios de tal manera que la distribución multivariada de X sea completamente caracterizada. En este trabajo, se utilizaron datos de un estudio regional de suelos de la Provincia de Córdoba para comparar el desempeño del método de muestreo cLHS con el muestreo aleatorio simple (MAS). Para evaluar el método de muestreo, se muestreó repetidamente la población de sitios con datos y se ajustó, en cada muestra, la relación entre COS y las propiedades edafo-climáticas del sitio, usando tanto modelos de regresión lineal como el algoritmo random forest de aprendizaje automático. Se evaluaron los errores de predicción de cada método de muestreo con cada método estadístico usado para la predicción de COS en sitios donde esta variable no fue medida. El método de muestreo impactó la confiabilidad global de las predicciones derivadas de ambos modelos de regresión y los errores de predicción sitio-específicos. El método cLHS fue más eficiente que MAS para identificar sitios con suficiente variabilidad para estimar el modelo de la relación entre COS y propiedades edafo-climáticas, usado para predecir en otros sitios del territorio el valor del COS. El modelo estimado puede ser usado para mapeo digital de COS.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Texture strongly influences the soil’s fundamental functions in forest ecosystems. In response to the growing demand for information on soil properties for environmental modeling, more and more studies have been conducted over the past decade to assess the spatial variability of soil properties on a regional to global scale. These investigations rely on the acquisition and compilation of numerous soil field records and on the development of statistical methods and technology. Here, we used random forest machine learning algorithms to model and map particle size composition in ecoforest polygons for the entire area of managed forests in the province of Quebec, Canada. We compiled archived laboratory analyses of 29,570 mineral soil samples (17,901 sites) and a set of 33 covariates, including 22 variables related to climate, five related to soil characteristics, three to spatial position or spatial context, two to relief and topography, and one to vegetation. After five repeats of 5-fold cross-validation, results show that models that include two functionally independent values regarding particle size composition explain 60%, 34%, and 78% of the variance in sand, silt and clay fractions, respectively, with mean absolute errors ranging from 4.0% for the clay fraction to 9.5% for the sand fraction. The most important model variables are those observed in the field and those interpreted from aerial photography regarding soil characteristics, followed by those regarding elevation and climate. Our results compare favorably with those of previous soil texture mapping studies for the same territory, in which particle size composition was modeled mainly from rasterized climatic and topographic covariates. The map we provide should meet the needs of provincial forest managers, as it is compatible with the ecoforest map that constitutes the basis of information for forest management in Quebec, Canada.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Digital soil mapping of organic carbon concentration in paddy growing soils of Northern Sri Lanka</b:Title>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>In this study we explore the environmental covariates that are useful in mapping SOC contents in tropical paddy growing soils in Northern Sri Lanka. We carried out digital mapping of SOC contents across the study area using a spatial soil prediction function with auto correlated errors via linear mixed models (LMMs). Two separate LMMs were fitted considering two depth intervals, 0 to 0.15 m and 0.15 to 0.30 m respectively. Results revealed that environmental covariates of SOC content for the two depth intervals considered in this study were different despite being situated within a zone typically considered as the top soil (0 to 0.3 m). Landsat 8 bands and its products derived from those bands (namely Landsat 8 band 2, band ratios 4/3 and 4/7) were identified as significant environmental covariates for both depth intervals. In terms of spatially auto correlated residuals, optimum spatial models for both depth intervals were identified as a spherical model. Residuals were found to be spatially auto correlated up to 10,000 m and 5000 m for 0 to 0.15 m and 0.15 to 0.30 m depth intervals respectively. Cross validation results suggest that fitted LMMs are adequate to carry out mapping across the study area with little difference between estimated bias (− 0.006% for 0 to 0.15 m and − 0.004% for 0.15 to 0.30 m depth intervals) and accuracy (0.441% for 0 to 0.15 m and 0.367% for 0.15–0.30 m depth intervals) for fitted LMMs considering two depth intervals. However, in case of Lin's concordance correlation value, 0 to 0.15 m depth interval reported higher value (0.81) compared to 0.15 to 0.30 m depth interval (0.60) suggesting upper depth interval model is much superior to the lower one. In conclusion, this study provides; a) firsthand information on current status of SOC contents in northern paddy growing soils in Sri Lanka, b) generated information that are useful to optimize spatial sampling of SOC in future applications and c) provided firsthand information vital to establishment of a national carbon accounting system in future.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Incorporating process-based modeling into digital soil mapping: A case study in the virgin steppe of the Central Russian Upland</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Lozbenev2021</b:Tag>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>In theoretical pedology, the advantage of factor-process-properties models over factor-properties models has been confirmed for the understanding of soil genesis and its changes over time. Currently, the most frequently used model in digital soil mapping (DSM) is the SCORPAN model, which is based on the Dokuchaev-Jenny formula: soil properties are the result of the interactions among soil-forming factors over time. This work aims to incorporate processed-based modeling into DSM and investigate the use of a hydrological model to predict the soil spatial heterogeneity and simulate its spatiotemporal evolution over time in the Central Chernozem Reserve (East European Plain). Our approach, called the Nested Landscape Soil Triad: Factor-Process-Properties, is based on the subordination of soil processes to landscape processes and the nesting of the soil system into the landscape. Landscape processes result in specific landscape properties, which control the direction and intensity of soil-forming processes, and thus control soil properties. We hypothesize that, in the virgin steppe, the result of moisture redistribution via runoff along topography (landscape process) can be expressed quantitatively in the redistributed runoff value (landscape property) that controls the movement of salts within the soil profile (soil-forming processes) and soil taxa (soil properties). We directly linked a result of the landscape process and soil properties due to difficulties in soil-forming processes modeling. We conducted a prediction across the 35 ha study area using a 2.5 m digital elevation model (DEM) and 157 soil profile descriptions as input. The moisture redistribution process was simulated using SIMulated Water Erosion (SIMWE), implemented in open-access software (GRASS GIS). To define the optimal parameter combination for the SIMWE model, we performed multiparameter sensitivity test and optimization. We used Latin Hypercube sampling to generate the 3000 × 6 (the size of sample per number of parameters) parameter set for Monte Carlo ensemble runs within SIMWE. The maximum correspondence between the soil cover pattern and simulated flow depth was achieved with infiltration values of 0–10 mm h−1, Manning’s n of −0.3 to 1.0, water diffusion constant of −0.3 to 0.5, threshold water depth of −0.1 to 0.15 m, diffusion increase constant of −3 to 6, and precipitation excess rate of 60 mm h−1. The runoff redistribution values alone determine the carbonate depth in the soils (64% accuracy) and soil taxa (76% accuracy). Overall, the Nested Landscape Soil Triad: Factor-Process-Properties can explore how soil properties have changed and will change through time and identify areas with risks of soil taxa changes. The contradiction between the selected optimal precipitation excess and current climate prove the polygenetic formation of forest-steppe soils. This approach can be used to inform policymakers and large-scale management to ensure soil security.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Generating spatially and statistically representative maps of environmental variables to test the efficiency of alternative sampling protocols</b:Title>

        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Accurate assessment of environmental variables is vital to understanding the global issues of land-use change and climate change, but is hindered by their high spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Extensive surveys are needed to model such large-scale problems, with their success dependent on adequate sampling protocols. We present a robust method for designing efficient sampling protocols for environmental variables. The SIMAP method involves the following steps: 1) Selecting sites that cover a representative range of spatial variability, 2) Intensive and spatially-accurate surveys within sites, 3) construction of continuous Maps that replicate the spatial and statistical variation of the surveys, 4) Accuracy simulations based on sampling of these maps and 5) determining a sampling Protocol for subsequent broader surveys. To illustrate the method, we used estimation of soil C stocks in mixed-species tree plantings and pastures to estimate carbon sequestration following reforestation. Soil C was surveyed intensively from these two land uses at several farms that covered a large rainfall gradient to provide contrasting datasets. In this example, sampling simulations showed that a systematic design generally required one less sample than a restricted-random design to achieve the same accuracy, while a simple-random design required substantially more samples. We found taking a minimum of 30 soil samples was needed for both bulk density and C concentration to accurately estimate soil C content within a 1-ha plot in a pasture or tree planting, which suggests many previous surveys of soil C were sampled inadequately. The SIMAP method could be readily applied to a range of abiotic and biotic variables, with the construction of maps allowing most sampling intensities and designs to be tested. Adequate sampling intensities differ widely among environmental variables, so the SIMAP method enables researchers to determine which variables require more investment. For many variables, costs may be minimised while maintaining a high accuracy of the sampling design via bulking of well-mixed samples prior to analysis.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Digital soil mapping across the globe</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Arrouays2017</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>Elsevier BV</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Digital soil mapping has largely expanded across the globe since the early 2000s. Numerous national, continental and global digital soil mapping products have been produced. In this paper, we review some major developments and highlight areas where progress is needed, including refinements in uncertainty assessments and increasing soil data collection. There are several useful top-down approaches, but we sense that digital soil mapping should be conducted at a regional or local level to be consistent with its use and application, and to ensure efficient soil data collection, and involvement of end users. Despite the numerous mapping activities, a concerted action is needed for enhanced investment in soil mapping, including capacity building and training the next generation of soil surveyors who are grounded in pedology as well as digital soil mapping.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Comparing the efficiency of digital and conventional soil mapping to predict soil types in a semi-arid region in Iran</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Zeraatpisheh2017</b:Tag>
        <b:Publisher>Elsevier BV</b:Publisher>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>The efficiency of different digital and conventional soil mapping approaches to produce categorical maps of soil types is determined by cost, sample size, accuracy and the selected taxonomic level. The efficiency of digital and conventional soil mapping approaches was examined in the semi-arid region of Borujen, central Iran. This research aimed to (i) compare two digital soil mapping approaches including Multinomial logistic regression and random forest, with the conventional soil mapping approach at four soil taxonomic levels (order, suborder, great group and subgroup levels), (ii) validate the predicted soil maps by the same validation data set to determine the best method for producing the soil maps, and (iii) select the best soil taxonomic level by different approaches at three sample sizes (100, 80, and 60 point observations), in two scenarios with and without a geomorphology map as a spatial covariate. In most predicted maps, using both digital soil mapping approaches, the best results were obtained using the combination of terrain attributes and the geomorphology map, although differences between the scenarios with and without the geomorphology map were not significant. Employing the geomorphology map increased map purity and the Kappa index, and led to a decrease in the ‘noisiness’ of soil maps. Multinomial logistic regression had better performance at higher taxonomic levels (order and suborder levels); however, random forest showed better performance at lower taxonomic levels (great group and subgroup levels). Multinomial logistic regression was less sensitive than random forest to a decrease in the number of training observations. The conventional soil mapping method produced a map with larger minimum polygon size because of traditional cartographic criteria used to make the geological map 1:100,000 (on which the conventional soil mapping map was largely based). Likewise, conventional soil mapping map had also a larger average polygon size that resulted in a lower level of detail. Multinomial logistic regression at the order level (map purity of 0.80), random forest at the suborder (map purity of 0.72) and great group level (map purity of 0.60), and conventional soil mapping at the subgroup level (map purity of 0.48) produced the most accurate maps in the study area. The multinomial logistic regression method was identified as the most effective approach based on a combined index of map purity, map information content, and map production cost. The combined index also showed that smaller sample size led to a preference for the order level, while a larger sample size led to a preference for the great group level.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>

        <b:Title>Optimal soil sampling design based on the maxvol algorithm</b:Title>
        <b:Tag>Petrovskaia2021OptimalSS</b:Tag>
        <b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Spatial soil sampling is an integral part of a soil survey aimed at creating a soil map. We propose considering the soil sampling procedure as a task of optimal design. In practical terms, optimal experiments can reduce experimentation costs, as they allow the researcher to obtain one optimal set of points. We present a sampling design, based on the fundamental idea of selecting sample locations by performing an optimal design method called the maxvol algorithm. It is shown that the maxvol-base algorithm has a high potential for practical usage. Our method outperforms popular sampling methods in soil taxa prediction based on topographical features of the site and deals with massive agricultural datasets in a reasonable time.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract>
