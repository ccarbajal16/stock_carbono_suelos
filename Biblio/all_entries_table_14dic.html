	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Digital soil mapping (DSM) is the most widely used method for producing spatial information of soil organic matter (SOM). Accuracy of the information is generally determined by modelling methods and sample sizes used for DSM. However, different studies present different importance of modelling method and sample size on accuracy of DSM, while they do not explore various combinations of modelling method and sample size. Based on the studies, it is supposed that there exists an optimal combination of modelling method and sample size for producing information of SOM accurately and economically. With SOM data of 1861 soil samples collected in Guangdong, China, the present study first assessed importance of modelling method and sample size and then examined if an optimal combination of modelling method and sample size existed for the area. Six modelling methods were explored, while 12 sample sizes were used, ranging from 100 to 1200 with an interval of 100. For each size, 10 repeated samples were randomly taken from a data of 1311 samples which were randomly selected from all the 1861 soil samples based on the probability distribution of the SOM data. The results showed that, for small sample sizes, the modelling methods have a greater impact on accuracy of DSM. However, for large sample sizes, e.g., more than 1000, the sample sizes have a much greater impact. Due to the varying importance of modelling method and sample size, there exists an optimal combination of modelling method and sample size for spatial prediction of SOM in the area, i.e., the combination of regression kriging and a sample size of 800. Thus, for economically producing detailed and accurate information on spatial distribution of SOM, it is recommended that a series of modelling methods and sample sizes are tried to identify an optimal combination of modelling method and sample size.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Accurate estimates of soil carbon (C) contents over large spatial scales require extensive sampling and are susceptible to error associated with landscape variability. Various methods to minimize error have been posed, including conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS). The potential advantage of cLHS is that it uses existing ancillary landscape data in geographic information systems to select stratified random samples. Although the theoretical basis for cLHS has been demonstrated, few empirical evaluations have been performed. This study compared simple random, stratified random, and cLHS predictions of soil C content and their associated variability. A population of 903 gridded samples was collected and then subsampled based on stratification of curvature, slope, land cover, and soil type using 1, 5, 12, and 35% data set proportions. Random stratified and cLHS methods best approximated mean and variance of the population at sample sizes of 5 and 12%. Large advantages of cLHS relative to stratified random sampling were not apparent at this site, although cLHS consistently sampled the tails of the soil C content population distribution. Mapped soil C contents from the three sampling methods using regression kriging resulted in root mean square error (±SE) values of 11.1 ± 0.5, 13.4 ± 0.3, and 10.1 ± 0.2 Mg ha−1, respectively, for random, stratified, and cLHS sampling. Stratification sampling methods such as cLHS and stratified random sampling use existing ancillary information to provide an effective means for stratifying sampling locations within existing feature space and can offer improved spatial predictions of landscape-associated soil C contents.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents the conditioned Latin hypercube as a sampling strategy of an area with prior information represented as exhaustive ancillary data. Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is a stratified random procedure that provides an efficient way of sampling variables from their multivariate distributions. It provides a full coverage of the range of each variable by maximally stratifying the marginal distribution. For conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) the problem is: given N sites with ancillary variables (X), select x a sub-sample of size n(n@?N) in order that x forms a Latin hypercube, or the multivariate distribution of X is maximally stratified. This paper presents the cLHS method with a search algorithm based on heuristic rules combined with an annealing schedule. The method is illustrated with a simple 3-D example and an application in digital soil mapping of part of the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, Australia. Comparison is made with other methods: random sampling, and equal spatial strata. The results show that the cLHS is the most effective way to replicate the distribution of the variables.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) method is a popular sampling allocation method within the digital soil mapping community, and allows soil practitioners to make use of existing information to produce an optimized sampling stratification. However, it often produces sampling schemes that are scattered around the landscape, resulting in plans that are costly to implement. This paper proposes to enhance the cLHS method by incorporating operational constraints into it, so that the output can be implemented in a cost-effective fashion. The cost of reaching each point in the landscape from the road network has been assessed using terrain and landcover attributes. This cost layer has then been used in the optimisation process of the cLHS algorithm to penalise the points that are difficult or impossible to reach in the field, and guide the sampling process towards schemes that are easier to implement operationaly. Results are illustrated using a real example in New Zealand.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: An improved identification of the environmental variables that can be used to predict the content of soil organic carbon (SOC) stored belowground is required to reduce uncertainties in estimating the response of the largest terrestrial carbon reservoir to environmental change. Recent studies indicate that some metal cations can have an active role in the stabilization of SOC, primarily by coordinating the interaction between soil minerals and organic matter through cation bridging and by creating complexes with organic molecules when their hydration shells are displaced. The effective cation exchange capacity (CEC eff.) is a measure that integrates information about available soil surfaces to which metal cations are retained. Therefore, we critically tested the relationship between CEC eff. and SOC content using regression analyses for more than 1000 forest sites across Switzerland, spanning a unique gradient of mean annual precipitation (640–2500 mm), elevation (277–2207 m a.s.l), pH (2.8–8.1) and covering different geologies and vegetation types. Within these sites, SOC content is significantly related to CEC eff., in both topsoils and subsoils. Our results demonstrate that, on a pH-class average, in Swiss forest topsoils (<30 cm depth) there is a strong confounding effect of soil organic matter contributing between 35 and 50% to the total CEC eff. In subsoils, soil organic matter has a negligible contribution to CEC eff., and the variation of CEC eff. is associated to the presence of inorganic surfaces such as clay content as well as iron- and aluminum- oxides and hydroxides. At pH > 5.5, between 59 and 83% of subsoil CEC eff. originates from exchangeable calcium, whereas in acidic soils exchangeable aluminum contributes between 21 and 44% of the CEC eff. Exchangeable iron contributes to less than 1% of the variability in CEC eff. Overall this study indicates that in Swiss forests subsoils, CEC eff. strongly reflects the surface of soil minerals to which SOC can be bound by metal cations. The strength of the relationship between CEC eff. and SOC content depends on the pH of the soil, with the highest amount of variation of SOC content explained by CEC eff. in subsoils with pH > 5.5.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: A programme scripted for use in an R programming environment called dissever is presented. This programme was designed to facilitate a generalised method for downscaling coarsely resolved earth resource information using available finely gridded covariate data. Under the assumption that the relationship between the target variable being downscaled and the available covariates can be nonlinear, dissever uses weighted generalised additive models (GAMs) to drive the empirical function. An iterative algorithm of GAM fitting and adjustment attempts to optimise the downscaling to ensure that the target variable value given for each coarse grid cell equals the average of all target variable values at the fine scale in each coarse grid cell. A number of outputs needed for mapping results and diagnostic purposes are automatically generated from dissever. We demonstrate the programs' functionality by downscaling a soil organic carbon (SOC) map with 1-km by 1-km grid resolution down to a 90-m by 90-m grid resolution using available covariate information derived from a digital elevation model, Landsat ETM+ data, and airborne gamma radiometric data. dissever produced high quality results as indicated by a low weighted root mean square error between averaged 90-m SOC predictions within their corresponding 1-km grid cell (0.82 kg m−3). Additionally, from a concordance between the downscaled map and another map created using digital soil mapping methods there was a strong agreement (0.94). Future versioning of dissever will investigate quantifying the uncertainty of the downscaled outputs.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Selection of training samples is a vital step in updating conventional soil maps when utilizing data mining models. Quality of training samples significantly affects the mapping results and accuracies of the updated soil maps. The area-weighted proportion method was a common method for generating training samples. However, this method usually assigns too small weight to those soil types of small areas and large weight to those of large areas in sample size allocation, which causes the unreasonable proportions of sample numbers for soil types and thereby biases the representation of soil-environmental relationships for those soil types. Meanwhile, random selection of training samples from a soil type may generate some ‘noise’ samples located in the transition areas between soil types. These two aspects in training sample selection could probably reduce the accuracy of the updated soil maps. In this study, a new method was developed to select training samples based on soil type grading according to their area coverages. The method consists of two steps. The first step is to determine the numbers of training samples for each soil type based on soil type grading so as to maintain the reasonable proportion in sample numbers among soil types with different area coverages. The second step is to select typical (representative) samples for each soil type from conventional soil map, to avoid generation of ‘noise samples’. To evaluate the proposed method, the method was compared with three other training sample selection methods with four training sample sizes. Each method was ran for 100 times to generate training sample datasets with each sample size to evaluate their effectiveness and stability. Random forest was employed to generate updated soil maps in a small watershed in Raffelson, Wisconsin (USA). The validation results showed that the graded proportion method effectively solved the imbalanced issue of training samples among soil types with area coverages in big differences caused by the area-weighted proportion strategy. Thus training samples generated using the proposed method usually obtained more accurate and reasonable mapping results than those using the area-weighted proportion strategy. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method was more stable than that of the area-weighted proportion strategy with the training sample size increasing. It is concluded that the proposed method is an effective training sample selection method for data mining model to update conventional soil maps.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We introduce Julia package ospats+ for optimal sampling design in the context of farm-scale soil carbon auditing. The main difference with package ospats is that ospats+ maximises the expected profit for the farmer, rather than the statistical criterion of estimation precision. The package is written in Julia for speed of computation. Our methodology has been discussed in general terms by de Gruijter et al. (2016), here we go into the computational aspects. Using a grid of predicted carbon content with associated uncertainty, we optimise a stratified random sampling design: number of strata, stratification of the grid, total sample size and sample sizes within strata. The expected profit is maximised on the basis of sequestered carbon price, sampling costs, and a trading parameter that balances farmer's and buyer's risks due to uncertainty of the estimated amount of sequestered carbon. The core of the methodology is optimisation of the stratification by the Ospats method (de Gruijter et al., 2015), an iterative procedure that re-allocates grid points to strata on the basis of pairwise generalised distances between grid points. The distances are a function of the locations, the predictions and the covariances of the prediction errors. We illustrate the use of ospats+ with an application to an Australian farm.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Effective soil management requires knowledge of the spatial patterns of soil variation within the landscape to enable wise land use decisions. This is typically obtained through time-consuming and costly surveys. The aim of this study was to develop a cost-efficient methodology for digital soil mapping in poorly-accessible areas. The methodology uses a spatial model calibrated on the basis of limited soil sampling and explanatory covariables related to soil-forming factors, developed from readily available secondary information from accessible areas. The model is subsequently applied in the poorly-accessible areas. This can only be done if the environmental conditions in the poorly-accessible areas are also found in the accessible areas in which the model is developed. This study illustrates the methodology in an exercise to predict soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration in the Limpopo National Park, Mozambique. Readily-available secondary data was used as explanatory variables representing the soil-forming factors. Conditions in the accessible and poorly-accessible areas corresponded sufficiently to allow the extrapolation of the spatial model into the latter. The spatial variation of SOC in the accessible area was mostly described by the sampling cluster (71.5%) and the landscape unit (46.3%). Therefore ordinary (punctual) kriging (OK) and kriging with external drift (KED) based on the landscape unit were used to predict SOC. A linear regression (LM) model using only landscape stratification was used as control. All models were independently validated with test sets collected in both accessible and poorly-accessible areas. In the former the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) was 0.42–0.50% SOC. The ratio between the RMSEP in the poorly-accessible and accessible areas was 0.67–0.72, showing that the methodology can be applied to predict SOC in poorly-accessible areas as successful as in accessible areas. The methodology is thus recommended for areas with similar access problems, especially for baseline studies and for sample design in two-stage surveys.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Collection of accurate and representative data from agricultural fields is required for efficient crop management. Since growers have limited available resources, there is a need for advanced methods to select representative points within a field in order to best satisfy sampling or sensing objectives. The main purpose of this work was to develop a data-driven method for selecting locations across an agricultural field given observations of some covariates at every point in the field. These chosen locations should be representative of the distribution of the covariates in the entire population and represent the spatial variability in the field. They can then be used to sample an unknown target feature whose sampling is expensive and cannot be realistically done at the population scale.<br><br>An algorithm for determining these optimal sampling locations, namely the multifunctional matching (MFM) criterion, was based on matching of moments (functionals) between sample and population. The selected functionals in this study were standard deviation, mean, and Kendall’s tau. An additional algorithm defined the minimal number of observations that could represent the population according to a desired level of accuracy. The MFM was applied to datasets from two agricultural plots: a vineyard and a peach orchard. The data from the plots included measured values of slope, topographic wetness index, normalized difference vegetation index, and apparent soil electrical conductivity. The MFM algorithm selected the number of sampling points according to a representation accuracy of 90% and determined the optimal location of these points. The algorithm was validated against values of vine or tree water status measured as crop water stress index (CWSI). Algorithm performance was then compared to two other sampling methods: the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) model and a uniform random sample with spatial constraints. Comparison among sampling methods was based on measures of similarity between the target variable population distribution and the distribution of the selected sample.<br><br>MFM represented CWSI distribution better than the cLHS and the uniform random sampling, and the selected locations showed smaller deviations from the mean and standard deviation of the entire population. The MFM functioned better in the vineyard, where spatial variability was larger than in the orchard. In both plots, the spatial pattern of the selected samples captured the spatial variability of CWSI. MFM can be adjusted and applied using other moments/functionals and may be adopted by other disciplines, particularly in cases where small sample sizes are desired.</td>

These assumptions are being put to the test in the Mojave Desert of California as part of a continuing effort within ongoing soil surveys. One of the questions being posed in this study is how comparable is a third-order soil map created by the conventional soil survey approach to one created via digital soil mapping. To compare the two mapping approaches the subgroup level of Soil Taxonomy was chosen as the response variable and the map unit as the unit of comparison. Within each map unit the proportion and number of subgroups predicted by each mapping approach was qualitatively compared. Within the intermontane basins the predictive model used for digital soil mapping, estimated a smaller proportion and number of soil subgroups associated with fan remnants. Whereas within the mountains the conventional approach predicted fewer soil subgroups, and a different composition of soil subgroups.</td>

An exploratory analysis showed that DEM, NDVI, MRVBF, MSP, b3/b2, b5/b7, SPI, SWI, SLOPE and ASPECT were correlated with soil properties. The models performance had a mean crossvalidation r2 of 0.13. The best results were achieved with kriging models, with a crossvalidation r2 of 0.19. A comparison between multiple linear regression and regression trees showed that the tree model yielded the best results. The sample density alone could not explain the results, but an interaction between DEM accuracy, sample density, covariates and geological conditions was suitable as an explanatory factor. Studies of tropical hillslope digital soil mapping on regional scales need to be more exhaustively focused to develop this research area.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: For obtaining maps of good precision by the spatial inference method, the distribution of sampling sites in geographical and feature space is very important. For a regional variable with trends, the predicting error comes from trend estimation, variogram estimation and spatial interpolation. Based on the cLHS (conditioned Latin hypercube Sampling) method, a sampling method called scLHS (spatial cLHS) considering all these three aspects with the help of ancillary data is proposed in this article. Its advantage lies in simultaneously improving trend estimation, variogram estimation and spatial interpolation. MODIS data and simulated data were used as sampling fields to draw sample sets using scLHS, cLHS, cLHS with x and y coordinates as covariates, simple random and spatial even sampling methods, and the distribution and prediction errors of sample sets from different methods were evaluated. The results showed that scLHS performed well in balancing spreading in geographic and feature space, and can generate points pairs with small distances, and the sample sets drawn by scLHS produced smaller mapping error, especially when there were trends in the target variable.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Soil property and class maps for the continent of Africa were so far only available at very generalised scales, with many countries not mapped at all. Thanks to an increasing quantity and availability of soil samples collected at field point locations by various government and/or NGO funded projects, it is now possible to produce detailed pan-African maps of soil nutrients, including micro-nutrients at fine spatial resolutions. In this paper we describe production of a 30 m resolution Soil Information System of the African continent using, to date, the most comprehensive compilation of soil samples (N≈150,000) and Earth Observation data. We produced predictions for soil pH, organic carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N), total carbon, effective Cation Exchange Capacity (eCEC), extractable—phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn)—silt, clay and sand, stone content, bulk density and depth to bedrock, at three depths (0, 20 and 50 cm) and using 2-scale 3D Ensemble Machine Learning framework implemented in the mlr (Machine Learning in R) package. As covariate layers we used 250 m resolution (MODIS, PROBA-V and SM2RAIN products), and 30 m resolution (Sentinel-2, Landsat and DTM derivatives) images. Our fivefold spatial Cross-Validation results showed varying accuracy levels ranging from the best performing soil pH (CCC = 0.900) to more poorly predictable extractable phosphorus (CCC = 0.654) and sulphur (CCC = 0.708) and depth to bedrock. Sentinel-2 bands SWIR (B11, B12), NIR (B09, B8A), Landsat SWIR bands, and vertical depth derived from 30 m resolution DTM, were the overall most important 30 m resolution covariates. Climatic data images—SM2RAIN, bioclimatic variables and MODIS Land Surface Temperature—however, remained as the overall most important variables for predicting soil chemical variables at continental scale. This publicly available 30-m Soil Information System of Africa aims at supporting numerous applications, including soil and fertilizer policies and investments, agronomic advice to close yield gaps, environmental programs, or targeting of nutrition interventions.</td>

The high dimensionality and grouped nature of this type of data can complicate standard analysis, summarization, and visualization. The “aqp” (algorithms for quantitative pedology) package was designed to support data-driven approaches to common soils-related tasks such as visualization, aggregation, and classification of soil profile collections. In addition, we sought to advance the study of numerical soil classification by building on previously published methods within an extensible and open source framework. Functions in the aqp package have been successfully applied to studies involving several thousand soil profiles. The stable version of the aqp package is hosted by CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aqp), and the development version is hosted by R-Forge (http://aqp.r-forge.r-project.org).</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: There is a growing demand for standardized, easily accessible, and detailed information pertaining to soil and its variability across the landscape. Typically, this information is only available for selected areas in the form of local or regional soil surveys reports which are difficult, and costly, to develop. Additionally, soil surveying protocols have changed with time, resulting in inconsistencies between surveys conducted over different periods. This article describes systematic procedures applied to generate an aspatial, terminologically, and unit-consistent, database for forest soils from county-based soil survey reports for the province of New Brunswick, Canada. The procedures involved (i) amalgamating data from individual soil surveys following a hierarchical framework, (ii) summarizing and grouping soil information by soil associations, (iii) assigning correct soil associates to each association, with each soil associate distinguished by drainage classification, (iv) assigning pedologically correct horizon sequences, as identified in the original soil surveys, to each soil associate, (v) assigning horizon descriptors and measured soil properties to each horizon, as outlined by the Canadian System of Soil Classification, and (vi) harmonizing units of measurement for individual soil properties. Identification and summarization of all soil associations (and corresponding soil associates) was completed with reference to the principal soil-forming factors, namely soil parent material, topographic surface expressions, soil drainage, and dominant vegetation type(s). This procedure, utilizing 17 soil surveys, resulted in an amalgamated database containing 106 soil associations, 243 soil associates, and 522 soil horizon sequences summarizing the variability of forest soil conditions across New Brunswick.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Both for mapping and for estimating spatial means of an environmental variable, the accuracy of the result will usually be increased by dispersing the sample locations so that they cover the study area as uniformly as possible. We developed a new R package for designing spatial coverage samples for mapping, and for random sampling from compact geographical strata for estimating spatial means. The mean squared shortest distance (MSSD) was chosen as objective function, which can be minimized by k-means clustering. Two k-means algorithms are described, one for unequal area and one for equal area partitioning. The R package is illustrated with three examples: (1) subsampling of square and circular sampling plots commonly used in surveys of soil, vegetation, forest, etc.; (2) sampling of agricultural fields for soil testing; and (3) infill sampling of climate stations for mainland Australia and Tasmania. The algorithms give satisfactory results within reasonable computing time.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: It has long been acknowledged that the soil spatial samplings used as inputs to DSM models are strong drivers – and often limiting factors – of the performances of such models. However, few studies have focused on evaluating this impact and identifying the related spatial sampling characteristics. In this study, a numerical experiment was conducted on this topic using the pseudo values of topsoil clay content obtained from an airborne Visible Near InfraRed-Short Wave InfraRed (Vis-NIR-SWIR) hyperspectral image in the Cap Bon region (Tunisia) as the source of the spatial sampling.<br><br>Twelve thousand DSM models were built by running a Random Forest algorithm from soil spatial sampling of different sizes and average spacings (from 200 m to 2000 m) and different spatial distributions (from clustered to regularly distributed), aiming to mimic the various situations encountered when handling legacy data. These DSM models were evaluated with regard to both their prediction performances and their ability to estimate their overall and local uncertainties. Three evaluation methods were applied: a model-based one, a classical model-free one using 25% of the sites removed from the initial soil data, and a reference one using a set of 100,000 independent sites selected by stratified random sampling over the entire region.<br><br>The results showed that: 1) While, as expected, the performances of the DSM models increased when the spacing of the sample increased, this increase was diminished for the smallest spacing as soon as 50% of the spatially structured variance was captured by the sampling, 2) Sampling that provided complete and even distributions in the geographical space and had as great spread of the target soil property as possible increased the DSM performances, while complete and even sampling distributions in the covariate space had less impacts, 3) Systematic underestimations of the overall uncertainty of DSM models were observed, that were all the more important that the sparse samplings poorly covered the real distribution of the target soil property and that the dense sampling were unevenly distributed in the geographical space, 4) The local uncertainties were underestimated for sparse sampling and over-estimated for dense sampling while being sensitive to the same sampling characteristics as overall uncertainty.<br><br>Such finding have practical outcomes on sampling strategies and DSM model evaluation that are discussed.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The use of the Conditional Latin Hypercube (cLHS) to select soil samples location to be used in the prediction of soil properties as soil organic carbon seems to be an important tool to decrease costs and subjectivity of sampling schemes. The main objective of this work was to test this method in a no sampled area, aiming to evaluate its efficiency in Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) procedures. The results show that this method was able to significantly increase the reliability in the spatial distribution of the sampled points in Parque Estadual da Mata Seca (PEMS). The study area is located in the North of Minas Gerais State, Brazil, in Tropical Dry Forest (TDF) ecosystems mainly. In this study, the cLHS algorithm developed by Minasny &amp; McBratney (2006) was used, in addition to some ancillary data as Land Use/Land Cover and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), in order to select 60 soil sampling location to the study of soil organic carbon and others soil properties. The cLHS will be further analyzed in its performance to select representative points to be sampled and how this method could be helpful for DSM.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are fundamental in assessing soil variability and are regularly used in Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) as a scale benchmark for all the other environmental covariates. They are conventionally used at their original grid resolution with a conventional 3 × 3 window size for the computation of the derived terrain attributes. The choice of scale frames the analysis and shapes the end result suggesting that better attention and quantitative knowledge of scale may improve predictive performance. Previous studies have shown the influence of pixel size but have not investigated in detail the interacting effect between window and pixel sizes. The aim of this study was to examine the scale dependency of soil classification performance at the landscape scale using two machine-learning techniques commonly applied in DSM: artificial neural networks and random forest. These were applied in three different areas in terms of their geomorphology and soil type located in Ireland. A series of DEMs representing different scales were created from the original 20 m DEM by smoothing and re-sampling it with different window and pixel sizes for a total of 143 combinations: the original, 10 smoothed but not re-sampled, 12 re-sampled and not smoothed, and 120 smoothed and re-sampled. These were used to generate 11 terrain parameters from which 4 points per km2 were randomly extracted and used to predict soil classes. The overall prediction accuracy in the three study areas varied between 35% and 60%. Pixel size was found significant in all areas, the interaction between window and pixel sizes significant in morphologically rough areas and window size was significant only in flat homogeneous areas at coarser resolutions (above 140 m in this study). In general, predictive performance was best at very fine and very coarse scales in morphologically varied areas, coarse scales in flat homogenous areas and relatively scale invariant in mixed areas. We conclude by examining whether this empirical approach is appropriate to compare scale combinations to obtain a better prediction accuracy of DSM techniques.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The growing demand of world food and energy supply increases the threat of global warming due to higher greenhouse gas emissions by agricultural activity. Therefore, it is widely admitted that agriculture must establish a new paradigm in terms of environmental sustainability that incorporate techniques for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. This article addresses to the scientific demand to estimate in a fast and inexpensive manner current and potential soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in degraded pastures, using remote sensing techniques. Four pastures on sandy soils under Brazilian Cerrado vegetation in São Paulo state were chosen due to their SOC sequestration potential, which was characterized for the soil depth 0-50 cm. Subsequently, a linear regression analysis was performed between SOC and Leaf Area Index (LAI) measured in the field (LAIfield) and derived by satellite (LAIsatellite) as well as SOC and pasture reflectance in six spectra from 450 nm - 2350 nm, using the Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) sensor of satellite Landsat 7. A high correlation between SOC and LAIfield (R2 = 0.9804) and LAIsatellite (R2 = 0.9812) was verified. The suitability of satellite derived LAI for SOC determination leads to the assumption, that orbital remote sensing is a very promising SOC estimation technique from regional to global scale.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Forest soils are important components in the global C-cycle. Regional soil organic carbon (SOC) stock assessments are hampered by low spatial densities of routine soil inventories. In this study, we estimated the SOC stock in the upper meter of forest in the region of Flanders (N. Belgium) using four digital soil mapping techniques, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), boosted regression trees (BRT), artificial neural networks (ANN) and least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVM), and compared them with the results of a multi-level spatial generalisation (MLSG) approach.<br>Applied to a collection of 276 soil profiles, we identified the highest groundwater level, clay fraction, tree genus and soil type as key predictors of the SOC stock in the upper 100 cm under forests. Overall, BRT was the most informative as it obtained the best fit (training R2 of 0.68, cross-validated R2 of 0.22) and provided insights in the soil system by showing average predictor effects in partial dependence plots. With BRT, the total stock in the upper meter of forest soil (153,544 ha) was estimated to be 26.99 Mt OC, or 17.58 kg m−2 on average. MLSG provided an estimate for only 90% of the forest area and resulted in a larger average stock of 18.22 kg m−2 due to larger predictions for Histosols. As a null model, i.e. assuming that the potential natural dominant tree genus would occur according to the present soil conditions, the SOC stock in the current forest area was estimated at 30.00 Mt OC, or 21.26 kg OC m−2 on average. When the complete non-built-up territory (1,168,850 ha) would be forested analogously, 255.28 Mt OC would be stored, which is more than double the amount of predictions under the actual land cover. The results highlight the importance to conserve and restore carbon hotspots like alluvial forests. New soil inventories should focus on these and other data-scarce land units. Future modelling approaches can benefit from explicitly taking the soil type and tree genus into account as predictors.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Dimensionality reduction methods such as principal components analysis (PCA) provide a means of identifying trends in soil characteristics which may be represented by a wide range of variables. However, these characteristics may be highly spatially variable and so the results from PCA represent, in some sense, an “average” of locally distinct characteristics. One approach to account for these local differences is to introduce a geographical weighting scheme into the PCA process. In this paper, such an approach is assessed in the exploration of soil characteristics in the state of Pennsylvania, USA. Data from 878 georeferenced soil profiles which include different soil parameters (n = 12) were extracted from the National Soil Survey Center database. Where data are parts of compositions (e.g., percentages of sand, silt, and clay), analysis using raw data is not appropriate and such data were transformed using log ratios (specifically, balances). Single variables (i.e., those which are not parts of compositions) were logged. The first two principal components explain over 50% of the variance. The mapped values suggest marked spatial variation in soil characteristics, but it is not possible to assess which of these variables explain most variation in particular regions from the simple maps of raw variables. Geographically weighted PCA (GWPCA) provides additional information which is obscured by PCA, and it also provides a set of component scores and loadings at all data locations. The soil variable with the largest loading at most locations of Pennsylvania is the logged base saturation (BSln), and this supports the findings of the conventional PCA analysis. While BSln loads most highly in most of the eastern third, the middle and the south west of the state, the northwest is less spatially consistent in terms of the variables which explain most variation. For GWPC 1, the variable with the second largest loading at most locations (i.e., primarily the south and west) is CEC.B1 (the log ratio of Ca, Mg, and Na to K and EXACID), while CEC.B2 (the log ratio of Ca and Mg to Na), pHln (logged pH) and BSln dominate in other areas. The GWPCA results suggest that there is marked spatial variation in multivariate soil characteristics across Pennsylvania state and that results from standard PCA obscure this considerable variation.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The rapid and accurate determination of soil chromium (Cr) is crucial for preventing toxic element pollution in soils and ensuring ecological security. Proximal sensing technology uses visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, which has been demonstrated to be a viable approach for monitoring soil Cr concentrations. However, at trace levels, soil Cr is not especially spectrally active, thus limiting the practical application of using corresponding spectral data for quantifying soil Cr concentrations. In this study, we hypothesized that fused proximal sensing and soil auxiliary attributes (including organic matter (OM) and pH) could improve estimation of Cr concentrations in the soil. Additionally, the introduction of best-fit variogram models was theoretically possible to improve spatial visualization. To address these hypotheses, we collected 168 soil samples from the open coal mine area in the Eastern Junggar Basin, China. Fractional-order derivative (FOD) pretreatment and optimal band combination methods were implemented for spectral data mining and the derivation of spectral parameters, respectively. Soil Cr estimation models were calibrated with a partial least squares (PLS) approach through four designed strategies with different predictors: (I) full Vis-NIR variables, (II) effective three-band spectral indices (TBIs), (III) the effective TBIs and OM, and (IV) the effective TBIs, OM, and the pH. The results suggest that FOD could identify abundant spectral variability. Compared with full Vis-NIR variables, the effective TBIs can effectively magnify the subtle spectral signals concerning soil Cr. The optimal estimation model was determined as Strategy IV, indicating that the introduction of soil auxiliary attributes (pH and OM) can improve the estimation performance of the model; notably, the coefficient of determination (R2) and ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) were 0.87 and 2.68, respectively. Based on the optimal semivariance model, we used kriging interpolation to map regional soil Cr. In the study area, the soil Cr distribution features strong spatial dependence and strong associations. Our study might inspire further research on soil contamination mapping based on proximal Vis-NIR sensors.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Soil scientists are using spectral data from vegetation to help predict soils for the North Cascades National Park (NCNP) Complex in Washington State, USA. Vegetation is a proxy indicator for the soil forming factors organisms and climate. Two objectives of this research are: (1) can spectral remote sensing data be used to accurately map vegetation in the NCNP; and (2) are soil characteristics and properties significantly correlated with vegetation cover? We characterized soil profiles and vegetation cover at 70 sites within the 30,000 ha Thunder Creek Watershed (TCW) in the summer of 2007. These ground truth locations were used to manually interpret 1 m resolution National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) color photography and classify 700 randomly selected validation locations as coniferous forest, shrub, meadow, heather, rock and snow. We applied Spectral Angle Mapper (ENVI version 4.3, ITT Visual Information Solutions; Boulder, CO) to July, 2007 ASTER data to classify vegetation cover for the TCW, with 3600 ground truth pixels and the 700 NAIP photograph pixels employed for calibration and validation respectively. This classification yielded an overall accuracy of 67% with coniferous forest having a producer’s and user’s accuracies of 84 and 91% respectively.<br><br>Standard Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) models were used to examine the correlation of genetic horizon thicknesses with vegetation cover. A-, O-, E- and Bs-horizon thickness were all highly significantly different (N = 70, p < 0.01) for these two classes. Moreover, the results confirmed conventional soil genesis theory with coniferous forest having thicker E, Bs and O-horizons but thinner A-horizons.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: A crucial decision in designing a spatial sample for soil survey is the number of sampling locations required to answer, with sufficient accuracy and precision, the questions posed by decision makers at different levels of geographic aggregation. In the Indian Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme, many thousands of locations are sampled per district. In this paper the SHC data are used to estimate the mean of a soil property within a defined study area, e.g., a district, or the areal fraction of the study area where some condition is satisfied, e.g., exceedence of a critical level. The central question is whether this large sample size is needed for this aim. The sample size required for a given maximum length of a confidence interval can be computed with formulas from classical sampling theory, using a prior estimate of the variance of the property of interest within the study area. Similarly, for the areal fraction a prior estimate of this fraction is required. In practice we are uncertain about these prior estimates, and our uncertainty is not accounted for in classical sample size determination (SSD). This deficiency can be overcome with a Bayesian approach, in which the prior estimate of the variance or areal fraction is replaced by a prior distribution. Once new data from the sample are available, this prior distribution is updated to a posterior distribution using Bayes’ rule. The apparent problem with a Bayesian approach prior to a sampling campaign is that the data are not yet available. This dilemma can be solved by computing, for a given sample size, the predictive distribution of the data, given a prior distribution on the population and design parameter. Thus we do not have a single vector with data values, but a finite or infinite set of possible data vectors. As a consequence, we have as many posterior distribution functions as we have data vectors. This leads to a probability distribution of lengths or coverages of Bayesian credible intervals, from which various criteria for SSD can be derived. Besides the fully Bayesian approach, a mixed Bayesian-likelihood approach for SSD is available. This is of interest when, after the data have been collected, we prefer to estimate the mean from these data only, using the frequentist approach, ignoring the prior distribution. The fully Bayesian and mixed Bayesian-likelihood approach are illustrated for estimating the mean of log-transformed Zn and the areal fraction with Zn-deficiency, defined as Zn concentration <0.9 mg kg −1, in the thirteen districts of Andhra Pradesh state. The SHC data from 2015–2017 are used to derive prior distributions. For all districts the Bayesian and mixed Bayesian-likelihood sample sizes are much smaller than the current sample sizes. The hyperparameters of the prior distributions have a strong effect on the sample sizes. We discuss methods to deal with this. Even at the mandal (sub-district) level the sample size can almost always be reduced substantially. Clearly SHC over-sampled, and here we show how to reduce the effort while still providing information required for decision-making. R scripts for SSD are provided as supplementary material.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Soils hold the largest pool of organic carbon (C) on Earth; yet, soil organic carbon (SOC) reservoirs are not well represented in climate change mitigation strategies because our database for ecosystems where human impacts are minimal is still fragmentary. Here, we provide a tool for generating a global baseline of SOC stocks. We used partial least square (PLS) regression and available geographic datasets that describe SOC, climate, organisms, relief, parent material and time. The accuracy of the model was determined by the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of predicted SOC against 100 independent measurements. The best predictors were related to primary productivity, climate, topography, biome classification, and soil type. The largest C stocks for the top 1 m were found in boreal forests (254 ± 14.3 t ha−1) and tundra (310 ± 15.3 t ha−1). Deserts had the lowest C stocks (53.2 ± 6.3 t ha−1) and statistically similar C stocks were found for temperate and Mediterranean forests (142 - 221 t ha−1), tropical and subtropical forests (94 - 143 t ha−1) and grasslands (99-104 t ha−1). Solar radiation, evapotranspiration, and annual mean temperature were negatively correlated with SOC, whereas soil water content was positively correlated with SOC. Our model explained 49% of SOC variability, with RMSD (0.68) representing approximately 14% of observed C stock variance, overestimating extremely low and underestimating extremely high stocks, respectively. Our baseline PLS predictions of SOC stocks can be used for estimating the maximum amount of C that may be sequestered in soils across biomes.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The current soil mapping produced by CIREN, covers a part of the current needs of the country related to soils of agricultural and forestry aptitude; at detail scales, however, there is a lack of soil studies and associated mapping related to such particular ecosystems as highland soils, wetland water soils, high mountain soils, soils of remote regions and island territories, both in detail and in thematic recognition and mapping. It is understood that this involves a high cost for field activities, however, digital soil mapping is able to cover a series of aspects related to the extension and spatial distribution of soils as predictive models for the growing demand in ecological and environmental aspects. Through the SCORPAN model, it is possible to generate a cartography that represents soil classes and thematic properties. Pedotransfer functions allow to estimate unknown variables through known soil properties, fitting to regression models. The capture of terrain morphological records together with soil samples that analyze physical, chemical and biological properties allow the use of these records as training data to validate the transfer functions.<br><br>This trial seeks to reflect the importance of applying digital soil mapping models in Chile for better resource management.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Las técnicas de cartografía digital de suelos (CDS) tienen un gran potencial para mejorar la consistencia, precisión, detalle y velocidad con la cual se produce la información espacial de propiedades del suelo a escala de lote. La información disponible relacionada con factores formadores del suelo, junto con recientes desarrollos informáticos y de análisis de datos, permitieron implementar procesos cuantitativos de generación de información acerca de las relaciones espaciales entre propiedades del suelo y cultivo de soja. El objetivo de esta tesis fue implementar y evaluar técnicas de cartografía digital de suelos (CDS) que ayuden a explicar y entender las relaciones entre patrones espaciales de propiedades del suelo y propiedades de rendimiento y calidad de soja a escala de lote. Para cumplir el objetivo, técnicas de CDS a escala de lote, fueron implementadas en 6 lotes, distribuidos en tres regiones agrícolas importantes de Argentina. La primera técnica de CDS consistió en integrar esquemas de muestreo de suelos basados en modelos (EBM) y el algoritmo Random Forest (RF) para predecir propiedades del suelo a escala de lote. Los resultados obtenidos sugieren que la integración EBM-RF puede llegar a ser una alternativa eficiente para predecir propiedades del suelo a escala de lote. Asimismo, se demostró que hipercubo latino condicionado (HCLc) es eficiente para capturar la variabilidad de predictores relacionados con factores de formación del suelo. La segunda técnica de CDS buscó aprovechar la información auxiliar digital disponible relacionada con factores formadores del suelo y la información contenida en la cartografía convencional de suelos disponible. De este modo se planteó una metodología para la desagregación de unidades cartográficas de suelo (DgUCS) y delimitación de zonas por tipo de suelo a escala de lote. Los resultados sugieren que la metodología de DgUCS fue eficiente para aumentar la escala de mapas de tipo de suelo en condiciones del sudeste bonaerense y el sur de Córdoba, mas no en condiciones del centro de Entre Ríos. Para esta zona, futuros trabajos se proponen para determinar las causas de la brechas de información entre la cartografía convencional de suelos y la encontrada en cada uno de los lotes. A partir de las zonas delimitadas por tipo de suelo, se analizaron las relaciones entre patrones espaciales de propiedades de suelo y cultivo de soja, en cada uno los lotes experimentales. Los resultados sugieren que la metodología de CDS utilizada para delimitar zonas por tipo de suelos, puede generar una base técnica y espacial para delimitar zonas para manejo sitio específico, mas no para generar zonas para cosecha diferenciada por calidad. Una discusión general fue planteada en el capítulo final, en la cual se prioriza los impactos generales de los resultados obtenidos y se plantean trabajos futuros que requieren realizarse para corroborar los resultados de esta tesis. En general, esta tesis aportó de manera significativa, conocimientos de aplicación de técnicas de CDS en la generación rápida, fácil, precisa y económica de información de suelos a escala de lote. También demostró que los patrones espaciales complejos, junto con la presencia de tosca y el manejo inadecuado de los suelos son determinantes de la mayoría de propiedades limitantes del rendimiento de la soja. Además ratificó que la información digital disponible está siendo subutilizada y que puede aportar mucho para entender las dinámicas espacio-temporales entre propiedades del suelo y cultivos. Los resultados obtenidos en esta tesis invitan a replantear las técnicas, metodologías y uso de la información disponible, para generar información de suelos a escala de lote. Además, sugieren involucrar una dinámica de trabajos que permitan evaluar la aplicación de tecnologías emergentes en los procesos de generación de conocimientos de patrones espaciales de suelos, y su relación con propiedades del cultivo, a escala de lote.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Prediction of soil attributes (properties and classes) in digital soil mapping (DSM) is based on the correlation between primary soil attributes and secondary environmental attributes. These secondary attributes can be obtained relatively cheaply over large areas. In the presence of these environmental covariates, a strategic sampling design needs to ensure the coverage of the full range of environmental variables. This could enhance the full representation of the expected soil properties or soil classes. This chapter presents the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) as a sampling strategy on existing data layers. LHS is a stratified-random procedure that provides an efficient way of sampling variables from their multivariate distributions. It provides a full coverage of the range of each variable by maximally stratifying the marginal distribution. This method is illustrated with examples from DSM of part of the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. Comparison is made with other methods: random sampling, equal spatial strata and principal component (PC). Results showed that the LHS is the most effective way to replicate the distribution of the variables.</td>

En este trabajo se aplicó la técnica de Mapeo Digital de Suelos (MDS), a través del Análisis de Componentes Principales (ACP), para obtener la distribución espacial de las unidades de suelo. El área de estudio corresponde a la cuenca del río Mixteco, con una superficie de 655 903 ha, que se ubica en el estado de Oaxaca. Para el MDS se emplearon covariables ambientales del tipo topográficas, hidrológicas, climáticas y geológicas. Las covariables ambientales de mayor impacto, en la distribución espacial de las unidades de suelo, en orden de importancia fueron las geológicas, topográficas y climáticas. La clasificación digital se basó en 142 áreas de entrenamiento y 60 sitios para la validación de resultados, distribuidos aleatoriamente. En la cuenca, de acuerdo al Sistema de Clasificación WRB de la FAO (2014), a través del MDS se identificaron de manera satisfactoria (precisión global de 76.67% y un Índice Kappa de 71.20) los siguientes grupos de suelos Cambisoles (35.8%), Fluvisoles (7.16%), Leptosoles (48.25%), Regosoles (8.00%) y Vertisoles (0.79%). El MDS determinó satisfactoriamente la distribución espacial de las unidades de suelo en la cuenca e identificó las covariables ambientales de mayor influencia.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: There is increasing interest in developing automatic procedures to segment landscapes into soil spatial entities that replace conventional, expensive manual procedures for delineating and classifying soils. Geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) partitions remote sensing imagery or digital elevation models into homogeneous image objects based on image segmentation. We used an object-based methodology for the detailed delineation and classification of soil types using digital maps of topography and vegetation as soil covariates, based on the Random Forests (RF) classifier. We compared the object-based method's results with those of a pixel-based classification using the same classifier. We used 18 digital elevation model derivatives and 5 remote sensing indices that were related to vegetation cover and soil. Using 171 soil profiles with their associated environmental variable values, the RF method was used to identify the most important soil type predictors for use in the segmentation process. A stack of raster-geodatasets corresponding to the selected predictors was segmented using a multi-resolution segmentation algorithm, which resulted in homogeneous objects related to soil types. These objects were further classified as soil types using the same method, RF. We also conducted a pixel-based classification using the same classifier and soil profiles, and the resulting maps were assessed in terms of their accuracy using 30% of the soil profiles for validation. We found that GEOBIA was an effective method for soil type mapping, and was superior to the pixel-based approach. The optimized object-based soil map had an overall accuracy of 58%, which was 10% higher than that of the optimized pixel-based map.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The predictive models used in digital soil mapping (DSM) need to be trained with data that most fully capture the variation of terrain and soil properties in order to generate adequate correlations between environmental variables and the occurrence of soil unities. Several methods have been used in DSM to evaluate the accuracy of these models. The aims of this study were to compare the use of three sampling procedures for training a classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm, and evaluate the predictive capacity of the models generated using four methods. The sampling procedures used were: simple random; proportional to the area of each soil mapping unit (MU), and stratified by the number of MUs. The evaluation methods tested were: apparent, percentage division, cross-validation with 10 subsets, and resampling with seven independent data sets. The accuracies of the models estimated by the methods were compared with the measured accuracies. This was achieved by comparing the maps generated, based on each sampling procedure, with the conventional soil map at the scale of 1:50,000. The sampling procedures influenced the number of MUs predicted and the accuracy of the models and of the maps generated. The proportional and stratified sampling procedures resulted in less accurate digital soil maps, and the accuracies of the models varied according to the evaluation method adopted. Random sampling resulted in the most accurate digital soil map and presented accuracy values that were similar for all the evaluation methods tested.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In the current paper we assess different machine learning (ML) models and hybrid geostatistical methods in the prediction of soil pH using digital elevation model derivates (environmental covariates) and co-located soil parameters (soil covariates). The study was located in the area of Grevena, Greece, where 266 disturbed soil samples were collected from randomly selected locations and analyzed in the laboratory of the Soil and Water Resources Institute. The different models that were assessed were random forests (RF), random forests kriging (RFK), gradient boosting (GB), gradient boosting kriging (GBK), neural networks (NN), and neural networks kriging (NNK) and finally, multiple linear regression (MLR), ordinary kriging (OK), and regression kriging (RK) that although they are not ML models, they were used for comparison reasons. Both the GB and RF models presented the best results in the study, with NN a close second. The introduction of OK to the ML models’ residuals did not have a major impact. Classical geostatistical or hybrid geostatistical methods without ML (OK, MLR, and RK) exhibited worse prediction accuracy compared to the models that included ML. Furthermore, different implementations (methods and packages) of the same ML models were also assessed. Regarding RF and GB, the different implementations that were applied (ranger-ranger, randomForest-rf, xgboost-xgbTree, xgboost-xgbDART) led to similar results, whereas in NN, the differences between the implementations used (nnet-nnet and nnet-avNNet) were more distinct. Finally, ML models tuned through a random search optimization method were compared with the same ML models with their default values. The results showed that the predictions were improved by the optimization process only where the ML algorithms demanded a large number of hyperparameters that needed tuning and there was a significant difference between the default values and the optimized ones, like in the case of GB and NN, but not in RF. In general, the current study concluded that although RF and GB presented approximately the same prediction accuracy, RF had more consistent results, regardless of different packages, different hyperparameter selection methods, or even the inclusion of OK in the ML models’ residuals.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this study, two approaches for spatial data extrapolation are investigated. The intention here is to predict at fine spatial resolution, total gamma radiometric counts across a large mapping extent (recipient site) on the basis of finely resolved information collected from a nearby donor site. The extrapolation methods used were a digital soil mapping (DSM) regression model approach and a multivariate multiple-point statistical (MPS) approach. Qualitative interpretation of the results from both extrapolation approaches across the recipient site in the Lower Hunter Valley, Australia (area ≈ 220 km2) shows promise in terms of highlighting known geochemical and physical variations of soils in this area. The extrapolated map was evaluated in a small portion of the study area (area ≈ 4 km2) where similar high-resolution gamma radiometric data were available. Results show comparable performance of both approaches where a root-mean-square error of 87 ppm was found. A concordance correlation coefficient value of 0.04 was found for the DSM approach, but higher for the MPS approach (0.16). Under the Homosoil framework, where soil point data and mapping are sparse, either method investigated in this study would be suitable as a ‘first-cut’ approach for developing a comprehensive soil information system in those areas.</td>

The efficiency of digital and conventional soil mapping approaches was examined in the semi-arid region of Borujen, central Iran. This research aimed to (i) compare two digital soil mapping approaches including Multinomial logistic regression and random forest, with the conventional soil mapping approach at four soil taxonomic levels (order, suborder, great group and subgroup levels), (ii) validate the predicted soil maps by the same validation data set to determine the best method for producing the soil maps, and (iii) select the best soil taxonomic level by different approaches at three sample sizes (100, 80, and 60 point observations), in two scenarios with and without a geomorphology map as a spatial covariate. In most predicted maps, using both digital soil mapping approaches, the best results were obtained using the combination of terrain attributes and the geomorphology map, although differences between the scenarios with and without the geomorphology map were not significant. Employing the geomorphology map increased map purity and the Kappa index, and led to a decrease in the ‘noisiness’ of soil maps. Multinomial logistic regression had better performance at higher taxonomic levels (order and suborder levels); however, random forest showed better performance at lower taxonomic levels (great group and subgroup levels). Multinomial logistic regression was less sensitive than random forest to a decrease in the number of training observations. The conventional soil mapping method produced a map with larger minimum polygon size because of traditional cartographic criteria used to make the geological map 1:100,000 (on which the conventional soil mapping map was largely based). Likewise, conventional soil mapping map had also a larger average polygon size that resulted in a lower level of detail. Multinomial logistic regression at the order level (map purity of 0.80), random forest at the suborder (map purity of 0.72) and great group level (map purity of 0.60), and conventional soil mapping at the subgroup level (map purity of 0.48) produced the most accurate maps in the study area. The multinomial logistic regression method was identified as the most effective approach based on a combined index of map purity, map information content, and map production cost. The combined index also showed that smaller sample size led to a preference for the order level, while a larger sample size led to a preference for the great group level.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Enhancing the spatial resolution of pedological information is a great challenge in the field of digital soil mapping (DSM). Several techniques have emerged to disaggregate conventional soil maps initially and are available at a coarser spatial resolution than required for solving environmental and agricultural issues. At the regional level, polygon maps represent soil cover as a tessellation of polygons defining soil map units (SMUs), where each SMU can include one or several soil type units (STUs) with given proportions derived from expert knowledge. Such polygon maps can be disaggregated at a finer spatial resolution by machine-learning algorithms, using the Disaggregation and Harmonisation of Soil Map Units Through Resampled Classification Trees (DSMART) algorithm. This study aimed to compare three approaches of the spatial disaggregation of legacy soil maps based on DSMART decision trees to test the hypothesis that the disaggregation of soil landscape distribution rules may improve the accuracy of the resulting soil maps. Overall, two modified DSMART algorithms (DSMART with extra soil profiles; DSMART with soil landscape relationships) and the original DSMART algorithm were tested. The quality of disaggregated soil maps at a 50 m resolution was assessed over a large study area (6775 km2) using an external validation based on 135 independent soil profiles selected by probability sampling, 755 legacy soil profiles and existing detailed 1:25 000 soil maps. Pairwise comparisons were also performed, using the Shannon entropy measure, to spatially locate the differences between disaggregated maps. The main results show that adding soil landscape relationships to the disaggregation process enhances the performance of the prediction of soil type distribution. Considering the three most probable STUs and using 135 independent soil profiles, the overall accuracy measures (the percentage of soil profiles where predictions meet observations) are 19.8 % for DSMART with expert rules against 18.1 % for the original DSMART and 16.9 % for DSMART with extra soil profiles. These measures were almost 2 times higher when validated using 3×3 windows. They achieved 28.5 % for DSMART with soil landscape relationships and 25.3 % and 21 % for original DSMART and DSMART with extra soil observations, respectively. In general, adding soil landscape relationships and extra soil observations constraints allow the model to predict a specific STU that can occur in specific environmental conditions. Thus, including global soil landscape expert rules in the DSMART algorithm is crucial for obtaining consistent soil maps with a clear internal disaggregation of SMUs across the landscape.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper presents a refinement of the dissever algorithm, a framework for downscaling spatial information based on available environmental covariates proposed by Malone et al. (2012). While the original algorithm models the relationships between the target variable and the covariates using a general additive model (GAM), the modified procedure presented in this paper allows the user to choose between a wide range of regression methods.<br><br>These developments have been implemented in an open-source package for the R statistical environment, and tested by downscaling soil organic carbon stocks (SOCS) maps available on two study sites in Australia and New Zealand using 4 different regression methods: linear model (LM), GAM, random forest (RF), and Cubist (CU). In this study, the spatial resolution of a set of reference maps were degraded to a coarser resolution, so to assess the performance of the different downscaling methods. On the Australian site, the 1-km SOCS coarse resolution map has been downscaled to a 90-m resolution. The best results were achieved using either CU or RF ( and 0.94 respectively). On the New Zealand site, the 250-m SOCS coarse resolution map has been downscaled to a 10-m resolution. The best results were achieved using GAM (). The results illustrate that the optimal regression methods for downscaling spatial information using dissever vary on a case-by-case basis. In particular, simpler approaches such as LM or GAM outperformed more complex approaches in cases where only a limited number of pixels are available to train the downscaling algorithm. This demonstrate the value of an implementation that facilitates testing of different regression strategies.</td>

As the smallest possible sample is important for efficient field work, what is the optimal sample size for digital soil mapping? An optimal sample size accurately represents the variability in the environmental covariates and provides enough samples for predictive models. This paper briefly reviews cLHS and investigates different sample sizes for representing five environmental covariates in a 30,000-ha complex landscape in the Great Basin of southwestern Utah. The cLHS code was run in Matlab™ (Mathworks, 2008) and statistical analysis was performed using the R statistical language (R Development Core Team, 2009). Graphical analysis for continuous data and chi-square analysis of categorical data suggested optimal sample size for this study area is approximately 200 to 300 (0.05–0.1%).</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Data preprocessing techniques generally refer to the addition, deletion, or transformation of the training set data. Preprocessing data is a crucial step prior to modeling since data preparation can make or break a model’s predictive ability. To illustrate general preprocessing techniques, we begin by introducing a cell segmentation data set (Section 3.1). This data set contains common predictor problems such as skewness, outliers, and missing values. Sections 3.2 and 3.3 review predictor transformations for single predictors and multiple predictors, respectively. In Section 3.4 we discuss several approaches for handling missing data. Other preprocessing steps may include removing (Section 3.5), adding (Section 3.6), or binning (Section 3.7) predictors, all of which must be done carefully so that predictive information is not lost or erroneous information is added to the data. The computing section (3.8) provides R syntax for the previously described preprocessing steps. Exercises are provided at the end of the chapter to solidify concepts.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The drawing of maps of soil quality at a large scale is increasingly being more useful to land planners and stakeholders. Nevertheless, it involves different methodological steps from the description of soil profiles in the field until the regional mapping of integrative soil quality index (IQI) values. The development of proper scoring functions is a paramount task for the calculation of these IQI values since every parameter needs to be standardized accordingly and weighting factors are usually estimated by multivariate techniques. The main goal of this study was to map soil quality in the Spanish region of Extremadura (commonly known by its rangelands called dehesas). To do that, i) we gathered information from 194 soil profiles described throughout the region, ii) we calculated the weighting factors of ten meaningful parameters used as indicators by using multivariate techniques (Principal Component Analysis, PCA; and Analytic Hierarchy Process, AHP), and iii) we developed standard scoring functions (SSFs) that represent the singularity of every variable (less is better, more is better). We established upper and lower limits for standardizing the values of each indicator properly. Regarding weighting factors, soil texture was highlighted by the PCA and nutrients by the AHP. Once IQI values were calculated, two regional maps of soil quality were drawn by using interpolation methods (ordinary kriging). The IQI maps showed remarkable spatial differences in soil quality presumably induced by land management. We conclude this methodology could be useful and we encourage other colleagues to test its effectiveness in places where soil data are available.</td>

The soil database was developed using data from different sources. The soil data are divided into three tiers: Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. Tier 1 Data are soil data that have been measured, collected, and reported by verified U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) or U.S. Air Force (USAF) reports based on measurements and testing including the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS). Tier 2 includes data that reports USCS classification, but the data have been collected from non-verified sources such as other non-USACE reports, web sites, and published articles. Tier 3 Data includes data with alternative soil classification systems such as agricultural and geological soil classifications and soil parameters. Tier 3 Data were converted into equivalent USCS classification system. The standalone database described in this report is being converted to a web-based tool for technology transfer. At the time of publication, the database includes Tier 1 Data for 53 countries, Tier 2 data for 16 countries, and Tier 3 Data for 31 countries.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: There is a global demand for soil data and information for food security and global environmental management. There is also great interest in recognizing the soil system as a significant terrestrial sink of carbon. The reliable assessment of soil carbon (C) stocks is of key importance for soil conservation and in mitigation strategies for increased atmospheric carbon. In this article, we review and discuss the recent advances in digital mapping of soil C. The challenge to map carbon is demonstrated with the large variation of soil C concentration at a field, continental, and global scale. This article reviews recent studies in mapping soil C using digital soil mapping approaches. The general activities in digital soil mapping involve collection of a database of soil carbon observations over the area of interest; compilation of relevant covariates (scorpan factors) for the area; calibration or training of a spatial prediction function based on the observed dataset; interpolation and/or extrapolation of the prediction function over the whole area; and finally validation using existing or independent datasets. We discuss several relevant aspects in digital mapping: carbon concentration and carbon density, source of data, sampling density and resolution, depth of investigation, map validation, map uncertainty, and environmental covariates. We demonstrate harmonization of soil depths using the equal-area spline and the use of a material coordinate system to take into consideration the varying bulk density due to management practices. Soil C mapping has evolved from 2-D mapping of soil C stock at particular depth ranges to a semi-3-D soil map allowing the estimation of continuous soil C concentration or density with depth. This review then discusses the dynamics of soil C and the consequences for prediction and mapping of soil C change. Finally, we illustrate the prediction of soil carbon change using a semidynamic scorpan approach.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Our understanding of the spatial distribution of soil carbon (C) pools across diverse land uses, soils, and climatic gradients at regional scale is still limited. Research in digital soil mapping and modeling that investigates the interplay between (i) soil C pools and environmental factors (“deterministic trend model”) and (ii) stochastic, spatially dependent variations in soil C fractions (“stochastic model”) is just emerging. This evoked our motivation to investigate soil C pools in the State of Florida covering about 150,000 km2. Our specific objectives were to (i) compare different soil C pool models that quantify stochastic and/or deterministic components, (ii) assess the prediction performance of soil C models, and (iii) identify environmental factors that impart most control on labile and recalcitrant pools and soil total C (TC). We used soil data (0–20 cm) from a research collected at 1014 georeferenced sites including measured bulk density, recalcitrant carbon (RC), labile (hot-water extractable) carbon (HC) and TC. A comprehensive set of 327 geospatial soil-environmental variables was acquired. The Boruta method was employed to identify “all-relevant” soil-environmental predictors. We employed eight methods - Classification and Regression Tree (CaRT), Bagged Regression Tree (BaRT), Boosted Regression Tree (BoRT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), Regression Kriging (RK), and Ordinary Kriging (OK) – to predict soil C fractions and TC. Overall, 36, 20 and 25 predictors stood out as “all-relevant” to estimate TC, RC and HC, respectively. We predicted a mean of 5.29 ± 3.58 kg TC m−2 in the top 20 cm with the best model. The prediction performance assessed by the Ratio of Prediction Error to Inter-quartile Range for TC stocks was as follows: RF > SVM > BoRT > BaRT > PLSR > RK > CART > OK. The best models explained 71.6%, 71.7% and 30.5% of the total variation for TC, RC and HC, respectively. Biotic and hydro-pedological factors explained most of the variation in soil C pools and TC; lithologic and climatic factors showed some relationships to soil C pools and TC, whereas topographic factors faded from soil C models.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: There is a need for soil C assessment in the soils of tropical and subtropical areas. We have aimed to quantify the spatial extent of SOC concentration and stocks under different land use and soil types in an 8118 ha area in southern Brazil. Common soils are Inceptisols, Ultisols and Mollisols, and the dominant land use is forest and vineyard. SOC data were modeled by 5 depths deriving values from spline functions. Regression kriging was used to model SOC concentration for each depth to 100 cm, and for producing a soil depth map. Uncertainty was estimated by empirical approach, using sequential Gaussian geostatistical simulation of the residuals. The Projected Natural Vegetation Soil Carbon (PNVSC) approach was used to evaluate changes in soil carbon due to land use change. Bulk density was estimated by pedotransfer functions. SOC stocks were calculated using the SOC prediction, bulk density and the soil depth map, and the stocks were corrected by cumulative mass coordinates. The models for SOC concentration prediction explained about 44% of the variance at 30–60 cm depth and with slightly lower values for other depths. Important covariates for prediction were Soil Order (Entisols), coordinate X, Aspect and the DEM. The model for the prediction of soil depth explained 43% of variance and important covariates were Soil Order (Entisol, Mollisol, Ultisol), Valley Depth and TWI. Soils under forest accumulated more carbon in the top 30 cm whereas soils under pasture had higher SOC levels with depth. Soils under arable crops and vineyard had the lowest SOC concentration. SOC concentration decreases by depth, as well as prediction intervals of uncertainty, until 60 cm depth. The SOC stocks (0–100 cm) varied between 104 t C/ha in vineyards on Alfisols, and 280 t C/ha in pasture areas on Oxisols. The PNVSC analysis showed that most soils had lost SOC compared to when they were projected to be under forest.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This study aimed to map SOC lateral, and vertical variations down to 1 m depth in a semi-arid region in Kurdistan Province, Iran. Six data mining techniques namely; artificial neural networks, support vector regression, k-nearest neighbor, random forests, regression tree models, and genetic programming were combined with equal-area smoothing splines to develop, evaluate and compare their effectiveness in achieving this aim. Using the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling method, 188 soil profiles in the study area were sampled and soil organic carbon content (SOC) measured. Eighteen ancillary data variables derived from a digital elevation model and Landsat 8 images were used to represent predictive soil forming factors in this study area. Findings showed that normalized difference vegetation index and wetness index were the most useful ancillary data for SOC mapping in the upper (0–15 cm) and bottom (60–100 cm) of soil profiles, respectively. According to 5-fold cross-validation, artificial neural networks (ANN) showed the highest performance for prediction of SOC in the four standard depths compared to all other data mining techniques. ANNs resulted in the lowest root mean square error and highest Lin's concordance coefficient which ranged from 0.07 to 0.20 log (kg/m3) and 0.68 to 0.41, respectively, with the first value in each range being for the top of the profile and second for the bottom. Furthermore, ANNs increased performance of spatial prediction compared to the other data mining algorithms by up to 36, 23, 21 and 13% for each soil depth, respectively, starting from the top of the profile. Overall, results showed that prediction of subsurface SOC variation needs improvement and the challenge remains to find appropriate covariates that can explain it.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Soil organic matter (SOM) plays an important role in soil fertility and C cycle. Detailed information about the spatial distribution of SOM is vital to effective management of soil fertility and better understanding of the process of C cycle. To date, however, few studies have been carried out to digitally map the spatial variation of SOM for rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantation at the regional scale in Hainan Island, China. In this study, a hybrid approach, random forest plus residuals kriging (RFRK), was proposed to predict and map the spatial pattern of SOM for the rubber plantation. A total of 2511 topsoil (0–20 cm) samples were extracted from a soil fertility survey data set of the Danzhou County. These soil samples were randomly divided into calibration dataset (1757 soil samples) and validation dataset (754 soil samples). In this study, stepwise linear regression (SLR), random forest (RF), and random forest plus residuals kriging (RFRK) were used to predict and map the spatial distribution of SOM for the rubber plantation, while generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) and classification and regression tree (CART) were employed to uncover relationships between SOM and environmental variables and further to identify the main factors influencing SOM variation. The RFRK model was developed to predict spatial variability of SOM on the basis of terrain attributes, geological units, climate factors, and vegetation index. Performance of RFRK was compared with SLR. Mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) were selected as comparison criteria. Results showed that RFRK performed much better than SLR in predicting and mapping the spatial distribution of SOM for the rubber plantation. The RFRK model had much lower prediction errors (ME, MAE, and RMSE) and higher R2 than SLR. Values of ME, MAE, RMSE, and R2 were 0.26 g/kg, 1.35 g/kg, 2.19 g/kg, and 0.86 for RFRK model, and were 0.65 g/kg, 2.99 g/kg, 4.37 g/kg, and 0.43 for SLR equation, respectively. Moreover, RFRK model yielded a more realistic spatial distribution of SOM than SLR equation. The good performance of RFRK model could be ascribed to its capabilities of dealing with non-linear and hierarchical relationships between SOM and environmental variables and of accounting for unexplained information in the random forest (RF) model residuals. These results suggested that RFRK was a promising approach in predicting spatial distribution of SOM for rubber plantation at regional scale.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Texture strongly influences the soil’s fundamental functions in forest ecosystems. In response to the growing demand for information on soil properties for environmental modeling, more and more studies have been conducted over the past decade to assess the spatial variability of soil properties on a regional to global scale. These investigations rely on the acquisition and compilation of numerous soil field records and on the development of statistical methods and technology. Here, we used random forest machine learning algorithms to model and map particle size composition in ecoforest polygons for the entire area of managed forests in the province of Quebec, Canada. We compiled archived laboratory analyses of 29,570 mineral soil samples (17,901 sites) and a set of 33 covariates, including 22 variables related to climate, five related to soil characteristics, three to spatial position or spatial context, two to relief and topography, and one to vegetation. After five repeats of 5-fold cross-validation, results show that models that include two functionally independent values regarding particle size composition explain 60%, 34%, and 78% of the variance in sand, silt and clay fractions, respectively, with mean absolute errors ranging from 4.0% for the clay fraction to 9.5% for the sand fraction. The most important model variables are those observed in the field and those interpreted from aerial photography regarding soil characteristics, followed by those regarding elevation and climate. Our results compare favorably with those of previous soil texture mapping studies for the same territory, in which particle size composition was modeled mainly from rasterized climatic and topographic covariates. The map we provide should meet the needs of provincial forest managers, as it is compatible with the ecoforest map that constitutes the basis of information for forest management in Quebec, Canada.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Increasingly intensive use of soil and its disorganized occupancy result in its degradation. There is a lack of more detailed information on soils and on soil surveys. Soil mappings are key for land sustainable management because they provide basic information about this natural resource and its distribution on the landscape. The production of highly detailed soil class and attribute maps, will only be possible using geotechnologies in combination with field data. The objective of this review was to emphasize the importance of soil surveys within a new paradigm, defined as Digital Soil Mapping (DSM). DSM requires: i)  the use of data from field sampling and analytical results from laboratories, including existing as well as newly collected data ii) the process of inference and of spacing includes a proposition of mathematical and statistical models based on soil observation, environmental covariates and other scorpan factors iii)  results should be presented as soil spatial system format with continuous and/or discrete data, added to the uncertainty of this information, which could be updated whenever new observations become available. The application of DSM will make it possible for soil spatial information, attributes and classes to be generated and be readily available in digital format with its associated uncertainty. Among the challenges for further implementation of several strategies available in DSM, the training of future generations of soil scientists should be a priority.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Over the last 10 years Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) has emerged as a credible alternative to traditional soil mapping. However, DSM should not be seen as an end in itself, but rather as a technique for providing data and information for a new framework for soil assessment which we call Digital Soil Assessment (DSA). Although still somewhat fluid, a procedural framework for DSM and DSA with its links and feedbacks is set out diagrammatically and discussed. A significant advantage inter alia of DSM over conventional methods in this context is the intended provision of estimates of predictor uncertainties. DSA comprises three main processes: (1) soil attribute space inference, (2) evaluation of soil functions and the threats to soils, and (3) risk assessment and the development of strategies for soil protection. Digital Soil Risk Assessment (DSRA) consists of integrating political, social, economical parameters and general environmental threats to DSA outputs for building, modelling and testing some scenarios about environmental perspectives. The procedure as a whole is illustrated using an example.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Creating accurate soil maps at small scales using traditional methods is a time consuming and expensive process. However, remote sensing techniques can provide spatially and spectrally contiguous data in a timely manner. For this study, 20 root zone soil moisture maps derived from Landsat images during the growing season were used for the detection of soil boundaries. A split moving window analysis along two demonstration transects in, respectively, a semi-arid desert and riparian area located in the Middle Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico showed that remotely sensed root zone soil moisture can reveal subsurface trends that can be used to identify soil boundaries which do not have a strong surface expression. Overall, the use of multiple remotely sensed root zone soil moisture images for soil boundary delineation shows great promise of becoming a valuable tool in the field of digital soil mapping.</td>

There are several useful top-down approaches, but we sense that digital soil mapping should be conducted at a regional or local level to be consistent with its use and application, and to ensure efficient soil data collection, and involvement of end users.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This article reviews the current research and applications of various digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques used to map Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) concentration and stocks following a systematic mapping approach from 2013 until present (18 February 2019). It is intended that this review of relevant literature will assist prospective researchers by identifying knowledge clusters and gaps in relation to the digital mapping of SOC. Of 120 studies, most were clustered in some specific countries such as China, Australia and the USA. The highest number publications were in 2016 and 2017. Regarding the predictive models, there was a progression from Linear Models towards Machine Learning (ML) techniques, and hybrid models in Regression Kriging (RK) framework performed better than individual models. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) was the most frequently used method for predicting SOC, although it was outperformed by other ML techniques in most studies. Random Forest (RF) was found to perform better than MLR and other ML techniques in most comparative studies. Other common and competitive techniques were Cubist, Neural Network (NN), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). Due to the inconsistency in various comparative studies, it would be advisable to calibrate the competitive algorithms using specific experimental datasets. This review also reveals the environmental covariates that have been identified as the most important by RF technique in recent years in regard to digital mapping of SOC, which may assist in selecting optimum sets of environmental covariates for mapping SOC. Covariates representing organism/organic activities were among the most frequent among top five covariates, followed by the variables representing climate and topography. Climate was reported to be influential in determining the variation in SOC level at regional scales, followed by parent materials, topography and land use. However, for mapping at a resolution that represents smaller areas such as a farm- or plot-scale, land use and vegetation indices were stated to be more influential in predicting SOC. Furthermore, unlike a previous review work, all recent studies in this review incorporated validation and 41% of them estimated spatially explicit prediction of uncertainty. Only 9.16% studies performed external validation, whereas most studies used data-splitting and cross-validation techniques which may not be the best options for datasets obtained through non-probability sampling.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Digital Soil Mapping and Assessment (DSMA) has progressed from challenging traditional soil science paradigms, through small scale prototyping, to large-scale implementation capturing quantitative measures of soil attributes and functions. This paper considers the future for DSMA in the context of a highly uncertain world where high-quality knowledge of soil dynamics will be important for responding to the challenges of sustainability. Irrespective of whether the need is for survival, increased productivity or broadening the services provided from land management, or simply securing the soil itself, we see DSMA as a fundamental approach and essential tool. With a broadening need and a strong foundation in the practice of DSMA now in place, the theory, tools and technology of DSMA will grow significantly. We explore expected changes in covariate data, the modelling process, the nature of base data generation and product delivery that will lead to tracking and forecasting a much wider range of soil attributes and functions at finer spatial and temporal resolutions over larger areas, particularly globally. Equally importantly, we expect the application and impact of DSMA to broaden and be used, directly and collaterally, in the analysis of land management issues in coming decades. It has the capacity to provide the background to a soil and landscape ‘digital twin’ and the consequent transformation in monitoring and forecasting the impacts of land management practices. We envision the continued growth of DSMA skills amongst soil scientists and a much broader community of practice involved in developing and utilizing DSMA products and tools. Consequently, there will be a widening and deepening role of public-private partnerships in this development and application.</td>

We outline the increased availability of data and covariates. Large efforts to rescue legacy data and to put them in a harmonized format are ongoing in many parts of the world. New countries are joining the GlobalSoilMap initiative. During the same time, significant progress have been made in the countries which were among the first to develop GlobalSoilMap products. We stress the recent trends in tools used for predictive mapping of soil properties. Some solutions were proposed to solve issues about data privacy. We give examples on how to move from DSM soil digital soil mapping assessment. Aligning our research with ongoing activities within the Global Soil Partnership of the FAO has been proven successful. A need was expressed to work on the uncertainty of indicators of prediction performances and to re-evaluate validation strategies. It is necessary to develop more intuitive metrics for uncertainty assessment for interpreting and evaluating soil maps. The main progresses, remaining issues and challenges and the way forward are summarized and we propose ambitious working plans and road-maps for the two WGs and stress their complementarities.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Multi-scale soil variations are increasingly employed to improve the accuracy for digital soil mapping (DSM). In this study, we attempted to explore a methodology of wavelet analysis on this topic. The terrain attributes of a study area were decomposed using the wavelet analysis, and the resulted components were applied to map soil organic carbon (SOC) content, pH and clay content using multiple linear regression (MLR) and regression kriging (RK). The results showed that the wavelet components strengthened soil-landscape relationships in terms of correlation coefficients, enhanced soil-landscape modelling in terms of MLR modelling coefficients of determination (R2). Compared with several standard DSM approaches, i.e., ordinary kriging (OK), MLR and RK with the original terrain attributes, the use of wavelet components improved the prediction accuracy at some scales, but not all the scales. Most of the improvements were at the slight to moderate levels, e.g., 3.66–14.24% increases in the accuracy based on mean error, mean absolute error, root mean square error and R2. Maps made with wavelet components were relatively smooth and sometimes contained hotspots due to characteristics of wavelet components, which differed a lot from those made by the standard DSM methods. The potential benefits of using wavelet components as predictors in DSM may be further revealed in the future when more predictor selection approaches and mapping methods are considered.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Classification of fields into management zones based on variability of soil fertility parameters is under use in precision agriculture. The study was conducted in west Wollega zone of Ethiopia covering nearly 40 km2 of agricultural land, with the aim to explain variability of soils in the field, classify soils into mapping units and produce a map of these soils at a scale of 1:10000 using geostatistics. In this paper, soil mapping units (SMUs) were interchangeably used with management zones. Ten SMUs were identified in the study site. The SMU mean pH value varied between 5.3 in the SMU6 and 6.4 in the SMU7. Variation in soil texture, pH, exchangeable acidity, exchangeable potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), cation exchange capacity (CEC), organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), and plant available phosphorus (AvP), were observed within and among SMUs. Variability of soil parameters ranged from 1.06% (Na) in the SMU5 to 172.94% (AvP) in the SMU8. The OC and AvP content of all SMUs were found in the very low and low critical ranges. Intensive grid sampling had helped to produce digital soil maps and exposed soil heterogeneity across the landscape. We suggest that classification of fields into management zones was a remedy to low crop production occurred from uniform applications of nutrients and chemical amendments to significantly varying soils.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We tested the performance of a formalized digital soil mapping (DSM) approach comprising fuzzy k-means (FKM) classification and regression-kriging to produce soil type maps from a fine-scale soil observation network in Rišňovce, Slovakia. We examine whether the soil profile descriptions collected merely by field methods fit into the statistical DSM tools and if they provide pedologically meaningful results for an erosion-affected area. Soil texture, colour, carbonates, stoniness and genetic qualifiers were estimated for a total of 111 soil profiles using conventional field methods. The data were digitized along semi-quantitative scales in 10-cm depth intervals to express the relative differences, and afterwards classified by the FKM method into four classes A–D: (i) Luvic Phaeozems (Anthric), (ii) Haplic Phaeozems (Anthric, Calcaric, Pachic), (iii) Calcic Cutanic Luvisols, and (iv) Haplic Regosols (Calcaric). To parameterize regression-kriging, membership values (MVs) to the above A–D class centroids were regressed against PCA-transformed terrain variables using the multiple linear regression method (MLR). MLR yielded significant relationships with R2 ranging from 23% to 47% (P < 0.001) for classes A, B and D, but only marginally significant for Luvisols of class C (R2 = 14%, P < 0.05). Given the results, Luvisols were then mapped by ordinary kriging and the rest by regression-kriging. A “leave-one-out” cross-validation was calculated for the output maps yielding R2 of 33%, 56%, 22% and 42% for Luvic Phaeozems, Haplic Phaeozems, Luvisols and also Regosols, respectively (all P < 0.001). Additionally, the pixel-mixture visualization technique was used to draw a synthetic digital soil map. We conclude that the DSM model represents a fully formalized alternative to classical soil mapping at very fine scales, even when soil profile descriptions were collected merely by field estimation methods. Additionally to conventional soil maps it allows to address the diffuse character in soil cover, both in taxonomic and geographical interpretations.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This study aimed to evaluate the performance of three spatial association models used in digital soil mapping and the effects of additional point sampling in a steep-slope watershed (1,200 ha). A soil survey was carried out and 74 soil profiles were analyzed. The tested models were: Multinomial logistic regression (MLR), C5 decision tree (C5-DT) and Random forest (RF). In order to reduce the effects of an imbalanced dataset on the accuracy of the tested models, additional sampling retrieved by photointerpretation was necessary. Accuracy assessment was based on aggregated data from a proportional 5-fold cross-validation procedure. Extrapolation assessment was based on the multivariate environmental similarity surface (MESS). The RF model including additional sampling (RF*) showed the best performance among the tested models (overall accuracy = 49%, kappa index = 0.33). The RF* allowed to link soil mapping units (SMU) and, in the case of less-common soil classes in the watershed, to set specific conditions of occurrence on the space of terrain-attributes. MESS analysis showed reliable outputs for 82.5% of the watershed. SMU distribution across the watershed was: Typic Rhodudult (56%), Typic Hapludult* (13%), Typic Dystrudept (10%), Typic Endoaquent + Fluventic Dystrudept (10%), Typic Hapludult (9.5%) and Rhodic Hapludox + Typic Hapludox (2%).</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this study, we produced a detailed digital soil map of topsoil texture and soil organic matter (SOM) content for 2.4 million ha of arable land in Sweden (DSMS). Three spatially exhaustive datasets (a laser-scanned digital elevation model, airborne gamma radiation scanning data and a legacy Quaternary deposit map) were calibrated against topsoil texture and SOM content in around 13,500 soil samples, using multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARSplines) modelling. We then deployed the MARSplines models to produce raster maps (50 m × 50 m) of clay, sand and SOM content. The modelling procedure was validated by an independent dataset of about 24,000 samples clustered on 544 farms (with a local sample density of one per 3 ha). The error in clay content was < 8% in 75% of the validation samples, while for sand content and SOM content it was 13% and 2%, respectively. Corresponding values for the farm-average level were 6%, 11% and 2%, respectively. Modelling efficiency values revealed that the clay content map was a considerable improvement over the mean of the reference values at national level, regional level and, in many cases, also farm level. However, SOM content predictions showed little or no improvement over the mean of the reference samples (at any scale), due to poor correlation with the exhaustive predictor variables at all three scales investigated. The DSMS soil geodatabase will continue to be improved and have more layers added, e.g. derived layers calculated from the primary clay, sand and SOM layers by use of pedotransfer functions. Practical use of DSMS is exemplified here in an internet application for deriving prescription files for precision agriculture.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Accurate and quantitative information on soil properties of each and every location is essential for site specific sustainable management of land resources. A study was conducted to predict the different key soil properties of Northern Karnataka as per GlobalSoilMap specifications using Quantile Regression Forest (QRF) Model. Along with Sentinel-2 data, terrain attributes such as elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index, topographic position index, plan and profile curvature, multi-resolution index of valley bottom flatness, multi-resolution ridge top flatness and vegetation factors like NDVI and EVI were used as covariates. Equal-area quadratic splines were fitted to soil profile datasets to estimate soil properties viz. pH, OC, CEC, clay, sand, silt, field capacity and permanent wilting point at six standard soil depths (0–5, 5–15, 15–30, 30–60, 60–100 and 100–200 cm) as per GlobalSoilMap specifications. The coefficient of determination (R2), mean error (ME) and root mean square error (RMSE) were calculated in order to assess model performance. Prediction interval coverage percentage (PICP) was calculated to evaluate the associated uncertainty predictions. The predicted soil properties are reliable with minimum errors and the QRF model captured maximum variability for most of the soil properties.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this study we explore the environmental covariates that are useful in mapping SOC contents in tropical paddy growing soils in Northern Sri Lanka. We carried out digital mapping of SOC contents across the study area using a spatial soil prediction function with auto correlated errors via linear mixed models (LMMs). Two separate LMMs were fitted considering two depth intervals, 0 to 0.15 m and 0.15 to 0.30 m respectively. Results revealed that environmental covariates of SOC content for the two depth intervals considered in this study were different despite being situated within a zone typically considered as the top soil (0 to 0.3 m). Landsat 8 bands and its products derived from those bands (namely Landsat 8 band 2, band ratios 4/3 and 4/7) were identified as significant environmental covariates for both depth intervals. In terms of spatially auto correlated residuals, optimum spatial models for both depth intervals were identified as a spherical model. Residuals were found to be spatially auto correlated up to 10,000 m and 5000 m for 0 to 0.15 m and 0.15 to 0.30 m depth intervals respectively. Cross validation results suggest that fitted LMMs are adequate to carry out mapping across the study area with little difference between estimated bias (− 0.006% for 0 to 0.15 m and − 0.004% for 0.15 to 0.30 m depth intervals) and accuracy (0.441% for 0 to 0.15 m and 0.367% for 0.15–0.30 m depth intervals) for fitted LMMs considering two depth intervals. However, in case of Lin's concordance correlation value, 0 to 0.15 m depth interval reported higher value (0.81) compared to 0.15 to 0.30 m depth interval (0.60) suggesting upper depth interval model is much superior to the lower one. In conclusion, this study provides; a) firsthand information on current status of SOC contents in northern paddy growing soils in Sri Lanka, b) generated information that are useful to optimize spatial sampling of SOC in future applications and c) provided firsthand information vital to establishment of a national carbon accounting system in future.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper a spatial downscaling method is explored for generating appropriate farm scale digital soil maps. The digital soil map product to be downscaled is an Australian national extent soil carbon map (100 m grid resolution). Taking into account the associated prediction uncertainties of this map, we used a simulation approach based on Gaussian random fields to generate plausible mapping realisations that were in turn downscaled to 10 m resolution for a farm in North-western NSW, Australia. We were able to derive both a downscaled map of soil carbon and associated prediction variance with this approach. Building further upon this development, we then incorporated a bias correction step into the spatial downscaling procedure which permits the inclusion of field observations as a way to moderate the downscaling results to better reflect actual conditions on the ground. Based on an independent validation dataset, it was found that incorporating field observations increase the concordance correlation coefficient to 0.8 from 0.2. This relatively lower correlation achieved using spatial downscaling alone was due to the national scale mapping for the study area being positively biased in the area of interest. It was found that downscaling that incorporates observational data was marginally better if not comparable to using a point-based digital soil mapping approach. The advantage of spatial downscaling is that it can be implemented in situations of data scarcity. This will be ideal for on farm soil monitoring in situations where detailed soil mapping is initially not available. For example, soil carbon auditing schemes requiring prior soil information for implementation of design-based soil sampling could potentially be universally applied with such a spatial downscaling approach.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Spatial information of soil carbon storage at national and global level is essential for soil quality and environmental management. Improved knowledge on the amount and spatial distribution of the carbon stock in soils is crucial in estimating changes in the terrestrial carbon dynamics and management options for carbon-storing. A study was conducted to map the soil organic carbon stock (SOC) over 56,763 km2 area of Western Ghats of south India using a digital soil mapping approach. Landsat data, terrain attributes, and bioclimatic variables were used as covariates. Equal-area quadratic splines were fitted to soil profile datasets to estimate soil organic carbon stock at six standard soil depths (0–5, 5–15, 15–30, 30–60, 60–100 and 100–200 cm) and Quantile Regression Forest (QRF) algorithm was used to predict the SOC stocks. Prediction of SOC stock was better for surface layer (R2 = 31–43%) and the performance was decreasing with depth (R2 = 7–21%). The modal performance was also compared with SoilGrids products. Although the spatial patterns were similar, the present predicted SOC maps outperformed SoilGrids products in terms of both R2 and RMSE. The predicted total soil organic stock in the Western Ghats ranged from 7.1 kg m−2 to 30.9 kg m−2 and the total estimated SOC was 917 Tg. The present high resolution SOC maps help to assess and monitor the soil health and preparation of proper land use planning.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Quantification of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks is quite useful for accurate monitoring of C sequestration. However, there are still substantial gaps in our knowledge of SOC stocks in many parts of the world, including the Himalayas. We investigated the total SOC stocks and its spatial distribution under different land use and land cover (LULC) types in montane ecosystems of Bhutan. 186 Soil profiles were described and sampled by genetic horizons at sites located using conditioned Latin hypercube sampling. SOC concentrations at the standard depths designated for the GlobalSoilMap.Net were estimated with an equal-area spline profile function. SOC concentrations at these depth intervals were digitally mapped to a fine resolution matrix of 90 m grid using regression kriging. We found significant influence of LULC categories on SOC concentration, SOC density, SOC stocks and their spatial distributions, although this influence decreased with increasing soil depth. The estimated mean SOC density in the top 1 m were highest in fir forest soils (41.4 kg m−2) and lowest in paddy land (12.0 kg m−2). Allowing for LULC relative areas, mixed conifer forest had the highest SOC stocks in the upper meter (12.4 Mt) with orchards the lowest (0.1 Mt). The total SOC stocks for the whole study area for the 0–5, 5–15, 15–30, 30–60 and 60–100 cm depths were 2.6, 5.0, 6.5, 7.5 and 5.4 Mt, respectively. The overall SOC stock of the study area for the upper meter was approximately 27.1 Mt. The combined forests accounted for more than 77.5% of the total SOC stocks of the study area. This and the relative SOC densities indicate that the conversion of even a fraction of forests to other LULC types could lead to substantial loss of SOC stocks. This loss of SOC stock is even greater when the decrease in aboveground biomass is also taken into consideration. However, appropriate management of the agricultural lands could increase their sequestration of atmospheric CO2.</td>

These soil data were collected for other purposes and there were only limited soil bulk density data (103), which is needed for estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) were estimated to be used in the modeling of organic soil carbon of topsoil (0–10 cm), using the scorpan model. The following environmental correlates were used as predictor variables: satellite data (Landsat ETM+), lithology and soil maps, and a DEM and its derivatives. This dataset represents the best organized soil dataset in Brazil and is working as an educational trial for Digital Soil Mapping using a variety of methods for predicting soil classes and their properties. Multilinear analysis and regression-kriging were used to perform the modeling. Seven different models were built and compared through statistical methods. The main difference between the models was the set of predictor variables used to perform them. In general, all models performed well to predict the SOC stock. Nevertheless, model 6 was considered the best one since it presented the smallest AIC and RMSE as it used existing soil information (polygon soil maps) as a predictor variable, in addition to the variables used in the other models. The results obtained with this model were used to map topsoil carbon stock at a spatial resolution of 90 m.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Detailed soil surveys involve costly and time-consuming work and require expert knowledge. Since soil surveys provide information to meet a wide range of needs, new methods are necessary to map soils quickly and accurately. In this study, multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks (ANNs) were developed to map soil units using digital elevation model (DEM) attributes. Several optimal ANNs were produced based on a number of input data and hidden units. The approach used test and validation areas to calculate the accuracy of interpolated and extrapolated data. The results showed that the system and level of soil classification employed had a direct effect on the accuracy of the results. At the lowest level, smaller errors were observed with the World Reference Base (WRB) classification criteria than the Soil Taxonomy (ST) system, but more soil classes could be predicted when using ST (7 soils in the case of ST vs. 5 with WRB). Training errors were below 11% for all the ANN models applied, while the test error (interpolation error) and validation error (extrapolation error) were as high as 50% and 70%, respectively. As expected, soil prediction using a higher level of classification presented a better overall level of accuracy. To obtain better predictions, in addition to DEM attributes, data related to landforms and/or lithology as soil-forming factors, should be used as ANN input data.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Increasingly, applications of machine learning techniques for digital soil mapping (DSM) are being used for different soil mapping purposes. Considering the variety of models available, it is important to know their performance in relation to soil data and environmental variables involved in soil mapping. This paper investigated the performance of eight machine learning algorithms for soil mapping in a tropical mountainous area of an official rural settlement in the Zona da Mata region in Brazil. Morphometric maps generated from a digital elevation model, together with Landsat-8 satellite imagery, and climatic maps, were among the set of covariates to be selected by the Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm to predict soil types using machine learning algorithms. Mapping performance was assessed using the confusion matrix, and the Z-test among the Kappa indexes of the matrices. In a conventional soil survey, the soils described and classified in the Brazilian System of Soil Classification [Argissolos Vermelho-Amarelos Distróficos – PVAd (Acrisols), Cambissolos Háplicos Tb Distróficos – CXbd (Cambisols), Gleissolos Háplicos Háplicos Tb Distróficos – GXbd (Gleysols), Latossolos Amarelos Distróficos – LAd (Xanthic Ferralsos), Latossolos Vermelho-Amarelos Distróficos – LVAd (Rhodic Ferralsols), and Neossolos Litólicos Distróficos – RLd (Neossols)] were grouped into composite mapping units (MU) using the conventional method. The eight algorithms showed similar performance without statistical difference (Kappa 0.42-0.48). The mapping of soils with varying slopes (LAd, LVAd, CXbd) showed lower accuracy, whereas soils on hydromorphic lowlands (GXbd) were classified more accurately. In map algebra, the result was rather satisfactory, with 63-67 % agreement between the conventional soil map and maps produced by machine learning. The areas with the largest disagreement in the DSM occurred in the LAd unit due to subtle color variation in the Latossolos mantle without a clear relation to any environmental variable, highlighting difficulties in DSM regarding hill slope landforms. Model performance was satisfactory, and good agreement with the conventional soil map demonstrates the importance of the DSM as a potential complementary tool for assisting soil mapping in mountainous areas in Brazil for the purpose of land use planning.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Accurate soil information is critically important for forest management planning and operations but is challenging to map. Digital soil mapping (DSM) improves upon the limitations of conventional soil mapping by explicitly linking a variety of environmental data layers to spatial soil point data sets to continuously predict soil variability across a landscape. Thus far, much DSM research has focussed on the development of ultrafine-resolution soil maps within agricultural systems; however, increasing availability of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data presents new opportunities to apply DSM to support forest resource applications at multiple scales. This project describes a DSM workflow using LiDAR-derived elevation data and machine learning models (MLMs) to predict key forest soil attributes. A case study in the Hearst Forest in northeastern Ontario, Canada, is used to illustrate the workflow. We applied multiple MLMs to the Hearst Forest to predict soil moisture regime and textural class. Both qualitative and quantitative assessment pointed to the random forest MLM producing the best maps (63% accuracy for moisture regime and 66% accuracy for textural class). Where error occurred, soils were typically misclassified to neighbouring classes. This standardized, flexible workflow is a valuable tool for practitioners that want to undertake DSM as part of forest resource management and planning.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Spatial distribution of soil types and soil properties in the landscape are important in many environmental researches. Conventional soil surveys are not designed to provide the high-resolution soil information required in environmental modelling and site-specific farm management. The objectives of this study were to investigate the relationship between soil development, soil evolution in the landscape, updating legacy soil maps and pedodiversity in an arid and semi-arid region. The application of Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) techniques was investigated with a particular focus to predict soil taxonomic classes and spatial distribution of soil types by soil observations and covariate sets representative of s,c,o,r,p,a,n factors. In the first study, focus is on establishing relationships between pedodiversity and landform evolution in a 86,000 ha region in Borujen, Chaharmahal-Va-Bakhtiari Province, Central Iran. From an overview study, we could conclude that landform evolution was mainly affected by topography and its components. A second study compares various DSM-methods and a conventional soil mapping approach for soil class maps in terms of accuracy, information value and cost in central Iran. Also, the effects of different sample sizes were investigated. Our results demonstrated that in most predicted maps, in DSM approaches, the best results were obtained using the combination of terrain attributes and the geomorphology map. Furthermore, results showed that the conventional soil mapping approach was not as effective as DSM approach. In the third study, different models of the DSM approach were compared to predict the spatial distribution of some important soil properties such as clay content, soil organic carbon and calcium carbonate content. Among all studied models, the terrain attribute “elevation” is the most important variable to predict soil properties. Random forest had promising performance to predict soil organic carbon. But results revealed that all models could not predict the spatial distributions of clay content properly. The minimum area of land that can be legibly delineated in a traditional (printed) map is highly dependent upon mapping scale. For example, this area at a mapping scale of 1:24,000 is about 2.3 ha but at a mapping scale of 1:1,000,000 it is about 1000 ha. A mapping scale of 1:1,000,000 is just too coarse to show a fine-scale pattern or soil type with any degree of legibility, but finer-scale soil maps are more expensive and time-consuming to produce. Thus, spatial variation is often unavoidably obscured. The fourth study of this dissertation focuses on downscaling and updating soil map methods. Thus, the objectives were to apply supervised and unsupervised disaggregation approaches to disaggregate soil polygons of conventional soil map at a scale of 1: 1,000,000 in the selected area. Therefore, soil subgroups and great groups were selected because it is a basic taxonomic level in regional and national soil maps in Iran. In general, we conclude that DSM approach and also disaggregation approach are capable to predict soil types and properties, produce and update legacy soil maps. However, still a number of challenges need to be evaluated e.g. influence of expert knowledge on CSM approach, resolution of ancillary data, georeferenced legacy soil samples data to validate disaggregated soil maps.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Digital soil mapping (DSM) is a successful sub discipline of soil science with an active research output. The success of digital soil mapping is a confluence of several factors in the beginning of 2000 including the increased availability of spatial data (digital elevation model, satellite imagery), the availability of computing power for processing data, the development of data-mining tools and GIS, and numerous applications beyond geostatistics. In addition, there was an increased global demand for spatial data including uncertainty assessments, and a rejuvenation of many soil survey and university centres which helped in the spreading of digital soil mapping technologies and knowledge. The theoretical framework for digital soil mapping was formalised in a 2003 paper in Geoderma. In this paper, we define what constitutes digital soil mapping, sketch a brief history of it, and discuss some lessons. Digital soil mapping requires three components: the input in the form of field and laboratory observational methods, the process used in terms of spatial and non-spatial soil inference systems, and the output in the form of spatial soil information systems, which includes outputs in the form of rasters of prediction along with the uncertainty of prediction. We also illustrate the history with a number of sleeping beauty papers that seem too precocious and consequently the ideas were not taken up by contemporaries and largely forgotten. It took another 30 to 40 years before the ideas were rediscovered and then flourished. Examples include proximal soil sensing that was developed in the 1920s, soil spectroscopy in 1970s, and soil mapping based on similarity of environmental factors in 1979. In summary, the coming together of emerging topics and timeliness greatly assists in the development of paradigm. We learned that research and ideas that are too precocious are largely ignored — such work warrants (re)discovery.</td>

The objective of this work was to propose a strategy for data pre-processing applied to digital soil mapping (DSM). Soil polygons on a training map were shrunk by 100 and 160 m. This strategy prevented the use of covariates located near the edge of the soil classes for the Decision Tree (DT) models. Three DT models derived from eight predictive covariates, related to relief and organism factors sampled on the original polygons of a soil map and on polygons shrunk by 100 and 160 m were used to predict soil classes. The DT model derived from observations 160 m away from the edge of the polygons on the original map is less complex and has a better predictive performance.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The objective of the work presented in this paper was to investigate how rasters of the probabilities of occurrence of soil classes may be used to create digital soil property maps and maps of their associated uncertainties. The approach we present is formalised in an algorithm we developed called “Digital Soil Property Mapping Using Soil Class Probability Rasters” (PROPR).<br><br>The soil class probability rasters were derived previously from a spatial disaggregation of the 1:250,000-scale Dalrymple Shire legacy soil polygon map from central Queensland, Australia.<br><br>We created digital soil property maps of soil pH 1:5 H2O and their uncertainties (as indicated by estimates of the limits of the 90% prediction interval) at six depth increments down the soil profile (0–5 cm, 5–15 cm, 15–30 cm, 30–60 cm, 60–100 cm, 100–200 cm). The calculation of the weighted mean soil pH value for each depth increment at each grid cell was based on reference pH values for each soil class and used the probabilities of occurrence at each grid cell as weights.<br><br>The calculation of the prediction interval limits for each depth increment involved sampling from the triangular distribution of the soil pH of each soil class using the soil class probabilities at each grid cell as weights in order to identify the number of samples to draw from each distribution. The 90% prediction interval limits were then estimated as the 5th and 95th percentiles of the distribution of samples drawn from the soil classes' triangular distributions.<br><br>The maps of soil pH displayed strong spatial patterns. Soil pH generally increased with depth. Uncertainty generally increased with depth. Validation on 300 randomly-selected soil profiles returned a Lin's concordance correlation coefficient of 0.193 at the surface increasing to 0.266 at depth. RMSE increased with depth from about 0.75 pH units at the surface to 1.15 at depth.<br><br>Soil class probability rasters are useful for generating digital soil property maps and maps of the associated uncertainties. Validation left room for improvement but the quality of the results is probably strongly affected by the quality of the spatial disaggregation that produced the soil class probability rasters. The PROPR approach may be useful in situations where profile observations are limiting but where legacy soil maps are available.<br><br>Generation of the soil class probability rasters to use in PROPR is a predictive exercise in itself and so is also subject to uncertainty. The probability rasters likely can be derived by several methods including logistic regression and data mining; the probability rasters we used were derived via spatial disaggregation of a legacy soil polygon map.<br><br>PROPR may be useful in situations where profile observations are limiting but where legacy soil maps are available. The soil class probability rasters need to be produced separately. Information on the within-soil-class variability of the target soil property at each depth increment must be known in order to establish the triangular distributions for the uncertainty estimation.<br><br>PROPR may reduce reliance on having sufficient soil profile observations in areas where such data is limiting. We used available profile observations to estimate the within-soil-class variability in order to establish triangular distributions for the soil classes in our study area, but the information required to do so could also be derived from legacy reports or expert knowledge.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Legacy soil maps typically consist of a tessellation of polygon soil map unit delineations where the map units consist of a defined assemblage of soil classes assumed to exist in more-or-less fixed proportions. There are several limitations in this kind of mapping approach that relate to the original intent of the soil survey, the effect of mapping scale, and the nature of soil polygon boundaries. Yet perhaps a more fundamental limitation is the fact that most of the time, the soil classes that comprise the soil map units are not mapped individually: in effect their spatial distributions are unknown beyond the qualitative indications given in the accompanying soil map unit report.<br><br>Spatial disaggregation of soil map units attempts to map the spatial distribution of the individual soil classes that comprise a legacy soil map. We developed an approach called “Disaggregation and Harmonisation of Soil Map Units Through Resampled Classification Trees” (DSMART). DSMART samples the polygons of a legacy soil map and uses classification trees to generate a number of realisations of the potential soil class distribution. The realisations are then used to estimate the probability of occurrence of the individual soil classes. These estimates are mapped as raster grids, which can overcome some of the limitations of mapping scale and polygon boundaries inherent in the original legacy soil map.<br><br>We demonstrate the DSMART approach on a legacy soil map from the former Dalrymple Shire in central Queensland, Australia. We mapped the estimated probability of occurrence of the 71 soil classes in the legacy soil map, as well as the most probable soil class, second-most-probable soil class and the degree of confusion between them as determined by a confusion index. Validation on 285 observed soil profiles indicated that for 48.4% of the validation profiles, the observed soil class was identified in the top three most probable soil classes.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this study we evaluated whether investing in more spatially detailed environmental covariates improves the accuracy of digital soil maps. We used a case study from Southern Brazil to map clay content (CLAY), organic carbon content (SOC), and effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) of the topsoil for a &nbsp; 2000 ha area located on the edge of the plateau of the Paraná Sedimentary Basin. Five covariates, each with two levels of spatial detail were used: area-class soil maps, digital elevation models (DEM), geologic maps, land use maps, and satellite images. Thirty-two multiple linear regression models were calibrated for each soil property using all spatial detail combinations of the covariates. For each combination, stepwise regression was used to select predictor variables incorporated in the model. Model evaluation was done using the adjusted R-square of the regression. The baseline model, calibrated with the less detailed version of each covariate, and the best performing model were used to calibrate two linear mixed models for each soil property. Model parameters were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood. Spatial prediction was performed using the empirical best linear unbiased predictor. Validation of baseline and best performing linear multiple regression and linear mixed models was done using cross-validation. Results show that for CLAY the prediction accuracy did not considerably improve by using more detailed covariates. The amount of variance explained increased only &nbsp; 2 percentage points (pp), less than that obtained by including the kriging step, which explained 4 pp. On the other hand, prediction of SOC and ECEC improved by &nbsp; 13 pp when the baseline model was replaced by the best performing model. Overall, the increase in prediction performance was modest and may not outweigh the extra costs of using more detailed covariates. It may be more efficient to spend extra resources on collecting more soil observations, or increasing the detail of only those covariates that have the strongest improvement effect. In our case study, the latter would only work for SOC and ECEC, by investing in a more detailed land use map and possibly also a more detailed geologic map and DEM.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Sampling density significantly affects the estimation of soil organic matter (SOM) concentration because it influences the interpolation accuracy. High sampling density may ensure adequate estimation, but it is costly. Low number of samples may underrepresent spatial variation and generate unacceptable predictions. Identifying a reasonable sampling density is challenging, especially where the topography is complex and characterized by slope-rich terrain. Here we addressed this challenge by taking a large region of complex topography as study area. The region had a total area of 1.24 × 105 km2 and can be separated into three typical landforms, namely, hill-mountain, valley-basin, and plain-platform. Out of 235,309 sampling sites, 188,247 were randomly selected as training sites, on which 20 sampling densities were designed and ordinary kriging was interpolated. The remaining 47,602 sites were used as testing sites to calculate the accuracies of SOM concentration predictions at different sampling densities in the entire region of complex topography and its various landforms. Overall, the prediction accuracy was positively correlated with the sampling density (R2 ≥ 0.98). Specifically, with increasing sampling density, accuracy improved slowly at first then rapidly. However, the tipping point at which prediction accuracy significantly improved with the increases of sampling density varied among the areas. These sampling densities were 0.10, 0.11, 0.10, and 0.09 samples per hectare for the entire region, valley-basin, hill-mountain, and plain-platform, respectively. Further comparisons showed that valley-basin was the landform that had the best performance in interpolation accuracy, followed by hill-mountain, entire region and plain-platform. Their normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) values were 23.86%–28.91%, 24.22%–29.54%, 25.32%–30.77%, and 31.21%–37.76%, respectively. Moreover, interpolation accuracy was more sensitive to sampling density in simple topography (flat regions such as plain-platform) than in complex landforms (slope-rich terrains like hill-mountain, and valley-basin). These variations in the relationships between interpolation accuracy and sample density suggest that topography must be considered when designing a scientific sampling density. More importantly, when a high level of interpolation accuracy and low sampling costs are required in regions of similar complex topography, our findings may help optimize soil sampling density.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Recently, the Global Map of Salt-affected Soils (GSSmap) was launched, which pursued a country-driven approach and aimed to update the global and country-level information on salt-affected soils (SAS). The aim of this paper was to present how Hungary contributed to GSSmap by preparing its own SAS maps using advanced digital soil mapping techniques. We used not just a combination of random forest and multivariate geostatistical techniques for predicting the spatial distribution of SAS indicators (i.e., pH, electrical conductivity and exchangeable sodium percentage) for the topsoil (0–30 cm) and subsoil (30–100 cm), but also a number of indices derived from Sentinel-2 satellite images as environmental covariates. The importance plots of random forests showed that in addition to climatic, geomorphometric parameters and legacy soil information, image indices were the most important covariates. The performance of spatial modelling was checked by 10-fold cross validation showing that the accuracy of the SAS maps was acceptable. By this study and by the resulting maps of it, we not just contributed to GSSmap, but also renewed the SAS mapping methodology in Hungary, where we paid special attention to modelling and quantifying the prediction uncertainty that had not been quantified or even taken into consideration earlier.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Unlike most of the USA, the western region still lacks initial soil mapping on many private and public lands. Spatially explicit soil data are needed to support a variety of land uses including energy development, mining, grazing, agriculture, forest products, recreation, wildlife habitat, species conservation and urban development. The wide diversity of lithology, geomorphology, climate, and vegetation and the vast, difficult-to-access terrain of western landscapes facilitated the development of digital soil mapping. Environmental covariates used in digital soil mapping in the western USA include derivatives of digital elevations models (DEM) and remotely sensed spectral data (RS). DEM-derived data are often used to represent climate and relief (geomorphology, microclimate). The low vegetation cover of arid, semiarid, and seasonally dry climates typical of the West facilitates the use of RS data and its derivatives. Landsat and ASTER data are the most common sources of RS data, and are used to represent organisms (vegetation type and density), parent material (lithology, mineralogy), and soil (mineralogy, wetness, other surface characteristics). Spatially explicit, digital environmental covariates have improved several aspects of soil survey in the western USA including pre-mapping, developing efficient and targeted field sampling plans, and implementation of spatial prediction models.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: There is a growing need for raster-based soil data to support modelling at regional and continental scales. The GlobalSoilMap consortium aims to satisfy this need with the production of a suite of digital soil maps of various soil properties at six standard depths for most of the land surface of the Earth. Initially, the maps will be produced using legacy soil data (soil data already available). In the United States, the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO2) database is a rich source of legacy soil information, but the STATSGO2 map is vector-based and soil components' soil property data is organised by horizon. We therefore applied the equal-area spline function to the soil components of STATSGO2 map units in order to obtain estimates of soil organic carbon (SOC) content at the GlobalSoilMap standard depth increments. Using these estimates, we calculated the weighted mean of SOC for each STATSGO2 map unit at each GlobalSoilMap.net depth increment and gridded these weighted means at 100 m resolution for the contiguous United States. The result is a set of maps of SOC content for each GlobalSoilMap depth increment accompanied by an indication of the within-map unit variability. In addition, we show how the use of other “metadata maps” is essential for avoiding misunderstandings about reported values and discuss some of the limitations of the approach.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Soil contaminant grades classified by thresholds of concentrations are important for land use and management. Mapping of the soil contaminant grades only focuses on the precise prediction of the relationship between the contaminant concentration of each spatial units and a predefined threshold. Thus, unlike sampling for other purposes, additional sampling should add more sites in areas with a high possibility of misclassification and fewer or no sites in areas with a low possibility of misclassification. To guide additional sampling for mapping of the soil contaminant grades, an error index based on Indicator Kriging (IK) is proposed in this paper. By linear transformation of the predicted value of IK and summing the standard variance of the prediction error, the error index contains both the closeness of predicted value to the threshold and the uncertainty of the prediction, and can reflect the possibility of misclassification of the soil contaminant grades. Also, due to the adoption of IK, it can avoid the smoothing effect, remove or lower the unstationary variation of original data by indicator transform, and do not required normal distribution to model the error variance. Based on the error index, an optimization method for additional sampling to map soil contaminant grades is then put forward by defining an objective function and employing the Spatial Simulated Annealing optimization method. The chromium concentration data of the study area in central China were used as a case study. According to a comparison of the proposed additional sampling optimization method with spatially even sampling method and spatially random sampling method, the case study demonstrated that the proposed optimization method based on the error index is superior to the other methods in improving the prediction precision of soil contaminant grades and that its performance is stable. The results suggest that the error index proposed in this paper can be used to generate a design for additional sampling to improve the mapping precision of soil contaminant grades.</td>

In this study, terrain factors were used as predictors, and the fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering method was used to make digital soil prediction mapping for soil organic carbon content, soil bulk density, soil depth, and soil gravel content in Nanshan forest farm in Jiyuan City of Henan Province. Based on the digital mapping results, the prediction mapping of soil organic carbon density and the estimation of soil organic carbon storage were realized. The results showed that the average soil organic carbon density in the study area based on the digital soil mapping method was 4.24 kg·m-2, the mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the prediction map were 0.08, 2.80 and 5.03 kg·m-2, respectively. The accuracy, stability and reliability of the prediction results were higher than the tradiation methods. The soil organic carbon storage in the study area was estimated to be 3.08×108 kg. Based on the digital soil mapping technology, only a small number of soil samples could be used to map and estimate the soil organic carbon density with high accuracy, which could characterize the spatial distribution characteristics of soil organic carbon density. This study provided a new way to estimate soil organic carbon storage, which would help to improve the accuracy and efficiency of soil organic carbon storage estimation.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Mapping soil properties such as soil organic matter (SOM), or soil organic carbon (SOC) content represent a problem often arising in agronomic and environmental surveys, since point data must be spatialized with the best interpolation. Deterministic methods (Inverse Distance Weighting, Splines, ecc.) do not account for the error, thus probabilistic methods as geostatistics (e.g. Ordinary Kriging, OK) have been successfully applied for many years. Maps derived from this kind of stochastic interpolation, based only on a recognized autocorrelation among measured points, could not be suitable in representing the reality, since they usually show a smoothed pattern. Hybrid interpolation methods, such as Regression Kriging (RK), combine an interpolation based only on point data and an interpolation based on a regression of the target variable with other continuous variables, spatially related, well known on the whole area.<br><br>In the Teramo province, central Italy, a set of 250 soil samples, collected from the surface horizon of agricultural soils is available. From these samples the estimation of soil texture, SOC, SOM related to texture and C/N both by OK and RK was performed. The following predictors were used for RK: (i) indexes derived from Landsat TM imagery, (ii) morphometric parameters derived from DEM, (iii) soil subsystems map 1:250,000. The maps obtained by both OK and RK in this survey show substantial agreement, without significant improvement in map accuracy using auxiliary information.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Digital Soil Mapping is becoming increasingly operational because of shared approaches, clear specifications (e.g., GlobalSoilMap) and more “practical” applications across the planet. In a 27,236 km2 French region located in the Northern Mediterranean area, this study evaluated four well-known Digital Soil Mapping approaches that were possibly applicable in the French context for inferring the GlobalSoilMap (GSM) grid using freely available data from the French spatial data infrastructure. These approaches used for soil input either a legacy 1:250,000 scale soil map—an area-weighted mean of soil mapping units and spatial disaggregation of soil mapping units (simulated)—or a set of 2024 legacy-measured soil profiles (1 profile/13.5 km2) associated with a set of soil covariates using random forest and random forest plus kriging. These methods provided estimates of 29 soil properties over a 100 m by 100 m grid, i.e., clay, sand, silt, coarse fragment, organic carbon contents, pH and CEC, at the four upper GSM-specified depth intervals, plus soil depth.<br><br>This experiment showed that the performances in mapping soil properties were highly variable (from R2 = 0 to R2 = 0.79). They were strongly correlated with the amount of spatially-structured variance of the soil properties captured by the available soil data. For example better performances were observed for organic carbon that is driven by large-scale climate variations than for texture and soil depth that are driven by short scale variations of parent materials and erosion–deposition ratio along a slope. Furthermore, the profile-based DSM models generally outperformed the soil map-based DSM models, and kriging did not improve the results of random forest. Finally improving the quality of soil data input was considered as the best way to improve the current mapping performances.<br><br>In addition to providing a GlobalSoilMap proof-of-concept for Northern Mediterranean areas, this paper illustrates how a prior analysis of the available soil data may help in the anticipated estimation of the mapping performances and in the prior selection of the most promising DSM models to reach these performances.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The short revisit time of the Sentinel-2 (S2) constellation entails a large availability of remote sensing data, but S2 data have been rarely used to predict soil organic carbon (SOC) content. Thus, this study aims at comparing the capability of multispectral S2 and airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data for SOC prediction, and at the same time, we investigated the importance of spectral and spatial resolution through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the variable importance in the prediction (VIP) models and the spatial variability of the SOC maps at field and regional scales. We tested the capability of the S2 data to predict SOC in croplands with quite different soil types and parent materials in Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium, using multivariate statistics and local ground calibration with soil samples. We split the calibration dataset into sub-regions according to soil maps and built a multivariate regression model within each sub-region. The prediction accuracy obtained by S2 data is generally slightly lower than that retrieved by airborne hyperspectral data. The ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) is higher than 2 in Luxembourg (2.6) and German (2.2) site, while it is 1.1 in the Belgian area. After the spectral resampling of the airborne data according to S2 band, the prediction accuracy did not change for four out of five of the sub-regions. The variable importance values obtained by S2 data showed the same trend as the airborne VIP values, while the importance of SWIR bands decreased using airborne data resampled according the S2 bands. These differences of VIP values can be explained by the loss of spectral resolution as compared to APEX data and the strong difference in terms of SNR between the SWIR region and other spectral regions. The investigation on the spatial variability of the SOC maps derived by S2 data has shown that the spatial resolution of S2 is adequate to describe SOC variability both within field and at regional scale.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Abstract Sampling design plays an important role in soil survey and soil mapping. Conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) has been proven as an efficient sampling strategy and used widely in digital soil mapping. cLHS samples are randomly selected in each stratum of environmental variables, thus the produced sample sets can vary significantly at different runs with the same sample size. Although variation of mapping accuracies caused by the randomness of cLHS has been realized and qualitatively mentioned in past studies. However, how the randomness of cLHS could quantitatively influence mapping accuracy has rarely been examined. In this study, we conducted experiments to examine how the sample randomness quantitatively influence soil mapping accuracy with different sample sizes, and analyzed the possible reasons from a pedogenesis perspective. The results showed that the largest range of mapping accuracies of 500 repeats was 39.5% at a sample density of 2.59 point/km2, while the smallest range was 7.3% at the maximum sample size with a sample density of 32.47 point/km2. The sample density for satisfactory prediction accuracies in our study area was at least 10.06  Point/km2. The results showed that both the allocation of sample points to each soil series and the typicality of sample points played important roles in mapping accuracies. But the deep reasons causing the unstable performance of cLHS at small sample sizes were the imbalanced class distribution of soil series and the overlap between soil series in the distribution of environmental covariates. Researchers need to be cautious about the output when applying cLHS with small sampling densities. Some effective approaches to address this issue include increasing the sample size, checking the sample allocations of a cLHS design with the assistance of legacy soil maps, or adding the legacy soil map as a variable during sampling design. When the sampling resources and legacy soil maps are limited for an area, fuzzy k-means clustering sampling could be a potential alternative. This study provides useful references for better understanding the uncertainty of cLHS when the sample density is small and selecting alternative sampling methods accordingly.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: A novel method for soil carbon auditing at farm scale based on data value is presented. Using a map of carbon content with associated uncertainty, it optimizes stratified random sampling: number of strata, stratum boundaries, total sample size and sample sizes within strata. The optimization maximizes the expected profit for the farmer on the basis of sequestered carbon price, sampling costs, and a trading parameter that balances farmer's and buyer's risks due to uncertainty of the estimated amount of sequestered carbon. The stratification is optimized by a novel method (Ospats), an iterative procedure that re-allocates grid points to strata on the basis of pairwise differences between predictions and covariances of prediction errors. Optimal sample sizes are calculated from variance predictions by Ospats. An application on an Australian farm has shown that soil carbon changes across farms and regions can be audited effectively using the proposed method. It is concluded that sample bulking and returning to the same sites in subsequent sampling rounds are not recommendable.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Accurate assessment of environmental variables is vital to understanding the global issues of land-use change and climate change, but is hindered by their high spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Extensive surveys are needed to model such large-scale problems, with their success dependent on adequate sampling protocols. We present a robust method for designing efficient sampling protocols for environmental variables. The SIMAP method involves the following steps: 1) Selecting sites that cover a representative range of spatial variability, 2) Intensive and spatially-accurate surveys within sites, 3) construction of continuous Maps that replicate the spatial and statistical variation of the surveys, 4) Accuracy simulations based on sampling of these maps and 5) determining a sampling Protocol for subsequent broader surveys. To illustrate the method, we used estimation of soil C stocks in mixed-species tree plantings and pastures to estimate carbon sequestration following reforestation. Soil C was surveyed intensively from these two land uses at several farms that covered a large rainfall gradient to provide contrasting datasets. In this example, sampling simulations showed that a systematic design generally required one less sample than a restricted-random design to achieve the same accuracy, while a simple-random design required substantially more samples. We found taking a minimum of 30 soil samples was needed for both bulk density and C concentration to accurately estimate soil C content within a 1-ha plot in a pasture or tree planting, which suggests many previous surveys of soil C were sampled inadequately. The SIMAP method could be readily applied to a range of abiotic and biotic variables, with the construction of maps allowing most sampling intensities and designs to be tested. Adequate sampling intensities differ widely among environmental variables, so the SIMAP method enables researchers to determine which variables require more investment. For many variables, costs may be minimised while maintaining a high accuracy of the sampling design via bulking of well-mixed samples prior to analysis.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: A geostatistical model was developed and applied to predict six soil properties and soil horizon thickness for mineral A, B and C soil horizons at the European scale and quantify the associated prediction uncertainties. The soil properties are pH, organic carbon content, organic nitrogen content, clay and sand contents and bulk density. The geostatistical model takes a regression cokriging approach, in which correlations between soil properties and across soil horizons are taken into account. Non-stationarities in the means and variances are represented by mapping units of the generalised European soil and land cover maps. The model was calibrated using the combined WISE, SPADE 1 and EFSDB databases, which jointly contain approximately 3600 soil profiles, irregularly distributed over Europe. The resulting model showed for most soil properties strong dependencies on soil type and land cover, moderate correlations between soil property residuals, strong correlations across horizons, and moderate spatial correlation of regression residuals. Kriging predictions and simulations were made on a 5 km by 5 km grid. Uncertainties in the resulting maps are large, particularly in under-sampled parts of Europe and in strata with large spatial variation. We conclude that geostatistical prediction and simulation are useful techniques to quantify uncertainties in soil property maps at the European scale, but that many more observations are required to fully exploit the relationship with explanatory variables and improve mapping accuracy. One important advantage of the techniques used is that they yield a full probabilistic model, as required by Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation analyses of spatially distributed dynamic models that use soil properties as uncertain input. In particular, the results of this study have been used to analyse how uncertainty in soil properties propagate through terrestrial greenhouse gas emission models.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Environmental changes in national parks are generally subject to constant observation. A particular case is parks located in mountains, which are more vulnerable to climate change and the binding of pollutants in mountain ranges as orographic barriers. The effectiveness of forest soil monitoring networks based on a systematic grid with a predetermined density has not been analysed so far. This study’s analysis was conducted in the Stolowe Mountains National Park (SMNP), SW Poland, using total Pb concentration data obtained from an initial network of 403 circle plots with centroids arranged in a regular 400 × 400 m square grid. The number and distribution of monitoring plots were analysed using geostatistical tools in terms of the accuracy and correctness of soil parameters obtained from spatial distribution imaging. The analysis also aimed at reducing the number of monitoring plots taking into account the economic and logistic aspects of the monitoring investigations in order to improve sampling efficiency in subsequent studies in the SMNP. The concept of the evaluation and modification of the monitoring network presented in this paper is an original solution and included first the reduction and then the extension of plot numbers. Two variants of reduced monitoring networks, constructed using the proposed procedure, allowed us to develop the correct geostatistical models, which were characterised by a slightly worse mean standardised error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) compared to errors from the original, regular monitoring network. Based on the new geostatistical models, the prediction of Pb concentration in soils in the reduced grids changed the spatial proportions of areas in different pollution classes to a limited extent compared to the original network.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The assessment of spatial variability of environmental variables such as soil properties is important for site-specific management. A geostatistical index that allows quantifying and characterizing the structure of spatial variability is fundamental in this context. Thus, this study aimed to develop a new spatial dependency index, called the Spatial Dependence Measure (SDM) for the spherical, exponential, Gaussian, cubic, pentaspherical, and wave semivariogram models; and comparing it with some of the indexes available in the literature. The SDM is also dimensionless, in the same way as the Spatial Dependence Index (SDI), also considering more parameters of the semivariogram, when compared to the Spatial Dependence Degree (SPD) and Relative Nugget Effect (NE) indexes. In a simulation data study, it is observed that the SDI and SDM indexes showed an advantage over the SPD (or NE). To exemplify the application of the SDM in the proposal for the classification of soil properties, we used estimates of geostatistical parameters presented in the two studies. The results indicate that the SDM can be a measure that, analyzed together with the SDI, can help to improve the description of the spatial variability structure. Thus, this study expands the number of geostatisitcal-based measures and increases the power of decision on the description of the degree of spatial variability of agricultural and soil attributes.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This work presents the first GlobalSoilMap (GSM) products for France. We developed an automatic procedure for mapping the primary soil properties (clay, silt, sand, coarse elements, pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), cation exchange capacity (CEC) and soil depth). The procedure employed a data-mining technique and a straightforward method for estimating the 90% confidence intervals (CIs).<br><br>The most accurate models were obtained for pH, sand and silt. Next, CEC, clay and SOC were found reasonably accurate predicted. Coarse elements and soil depth were the least accurate of all models. Overall, all models were considered robust; important indicators for this were 1) the small difference in model diagnostics between the calibration and cross-validation set, 2) the unbiased mean predictions, 3) the smaller spatial structure of the prediction residuals in comparison to the observations and 4) the similar performance compared to other developed GlobalSoilMap products. Nevertheless, the confidence intervals (CIs) were rather wide for all soil properties. The median predictions became less reliable with increasing depth, as indicated by the increase of CIs with depth. In addition, model accuracy and the corresponding CIs varied depending on the soil variable of interest, soil depth and geographic location. These findings indicated that the CIs are as informative as the model diagnostics.<br><br>In conclusion, the presented method resulted in reasonably accurate predictions for the majority of the soil properties. End users can employ the products for different purposes, as was demonstrated with some practical examples. The mapping routine is flexible for cloud-computing and provides ample opportunity to be further developed when desired by its users. This allows regional and international GSM partners with fewer resources to develop their own products or, otherwise, to improve the current routine and work together towards a robust high-resolution digital soil map of the world.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The use of new technologies, the development of new software, and the advances in the machines ability to process data have brought a new perspective to soil science and especially to pedology, with the advent of digital soil mapping (DSM). To meet the demand for soil surveys in Brazil, it will be necessary to popularize the techniques used in DSM. To identify and map the soil to generate maps of land use capability, we proposed a theoretical and practical course focused on the training in DSM for professionals involved in the management of land resources. The methodology was divided into five modules: I. Introduction to pedology, soil-landscape relationship, soil survey and soil classification (theory); II. Identification of soils in the field and study of the soil-landscape relationship (practice); III. Digital soil mapping and geographic information system (theory) and obtaining environmental covariates (practice); IV. Statistical learners and quality measures of spatial predictions (theory) and spatial pseudo-sampling (practice); V. Database organization, calibration, and validation of predictive models (practice). Results such as the average level of confidence of the participants in the soil classification, as well as the number of pseudo-sampling classified by the participants, chosen statistical apprentice, environmental covariables used, and overall accuracy, were influenced by the participants level of knowledge regarding DSM soils and techniques. The structure, focus, and time of each module should be based on the participants needs. It is suggested that a survey should be carried out to consider the level of knowledge in relation to the topics addressed in DSM before the preparation and execution of the course. The contribution of individual experiences showed the importance of multidisciplinarity in the teaching-learning process because it is a technique that involves soil knowledge, statistics, and mathematics applied to geoinformation science to understand soil variability in the landscape. The practical classes were fundamental, enabling an approximation of the content studied with the participants’ reality and consolidation of the acquired knowledge. In general, the course was well evaluated by the participants regarding the contents covered and practical field training and laboratory geoprocessing, who reported that the practical classes were fundamental for the appropriation of knowledge in DSM. This course could be a model for the PronaSolos, which tend to have heterogeneous groups of participants, being necessary to plan specific protocols to tend the particularity.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Knowledge of how many sampling points are needed to estimate the mean content of soil nutrients in agricultural fields, given a precision requirement on the estimated mean, is limited. This paper describes a versatile geostatistical simulation approach for predicting the variance of the mean nitrate-N (NO3-N) content within an agricultural field estimated by random sampling. In fall of 2016 sixteen agricultural fields were sampled on a square grid to model the spatial variation of NO3-N. On twelve out of sixteen fields NO3-N showed a lognormal distribution rather than a normal distribution. Variograms for (log-transformed) NO3-N are estimated using a Bayesian approach, resulting in 100 vectors with possible variogram parameters per field, obtained by MCMC sampling from the posterior distribution. Each of these variograms is used to simulate 100 maps of NO3-N, resulting in 100 × 100 maps of NO3-N per field. Each map is used to compute the variance of the estimated mean with stratified simple random sampling of  points, with one point per compact geographical stratum. For each sample size (number of sampling points) the mean, median and P90 of the uncertainty distribution are computed. Based on the medians, the sample size required for a maximum expanded measurement uncertainty of 50% varies from  to . This large variation in required sample size shows the large variation among the sixteen fields in variance of NO3-N within a field.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: If a map is constructed through prediction with a statistical or non-statistical model, the sampling design used for selecting the sample on which the model is fitted plays a key role in the final map accuracy. Several sampling designs are available for selecting these calibration samples. Commonly, sampling designs for mapping are compared in real-world case studies by selecting just one sample for each of the sampling designs under study. In this study, we show that sampling designs for mapping are better compared on the basis of the distribution of the map quality indices over repeated selection of the calibration sample. In practice this is only feasible by subsampling a large dataset representing the population of interest, or by selecting calibration samples from a map depicting the study variable. This is illustrated with two real-world case studies. In the first case study a quantitative variable, soil organic carbon, is mapped by kriging with an external drift in France, whereas in the second case a categorical variable, land cover, is mapped by random forest in a region in France. The performance of two sampling designs for mapping are compared: simple random sampling and conditioned Latin hypercube sampling, at various sample sizes. We show that in both case studies the sampling distributions of map quality indices obtained with the two sampling design types, for a given sample size, show large variation and largely overlap. This shows that when comparing sampling designs for mapping on the basis of a single sample selected per design, there is a serious risk of an incidental result.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Urbanization is among the most impetuous current land-use change trends, resulting in a permanently increasing role of urban ecosystems in regional and global environments. Urban soil organic carbon (SOC) is probably the least understood stocks because of the lack of appropriate methodology to analyze and map it. Cities represent a small-scale patchwork of very contrasting soil features. This creates high short-term spatial variability. Urban-specific factors including size and age of the city, soil sealing and cut-off profiles dominate the anthropogenic soil forming factors. Considering these specific urban environments, our study aimed to adapt the digital soil mapping (DSM) approach to map topsoil and subsoil SOC stocks in a highly urbanized region. Field SOC data collected for different environmental conditions in the Moscow region (five soil types and five land-use types of 244 mixed samples for topsoil and subsoil) were linked to available auxiliary data, including both traditional (relief, climate, vegetation etc.) and urban-specific (functional zoning, size and history of the settlements) factors. Separate general linear models (GLM) were developed for the three different cases: i) excluding urban areas from the analysis (non-urban model); ii) including urban areas but only considering traditional soil forming factors (conventional model); and iii) including urban factors (urban-specific model). Total and specific carbon stocks, spatial variability represented by coefficient of variance (CV %) and the determination coefficient with a validation dataset were compared for the three models. The conventional model dramatically overestimated carbon stocks and underestimated of SOC's spatial variability. Total and specific carbon stocks estimated by non-urban model were 10–15% less than ones given by urban-specific model. The urban-specific performed best and explained more than 30% of total variability. Urban areas showed the highest spatial variability and specific carbon stocks, 90% of which was stored in subsoils. Even when the high uncertainty of the absolute values is considered, urban areas contributed to regional carbon stocks. Considering urban-specific factors to estimate carbon stocks and their spatial variability is thus necessary.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Landscape characteristics show local, regional and supra-regional components. As a result pedogenesis and the spatial distribution of soil properties are both influenced by features emerging at multiple scales. To account for this effect in a predictive model, descriptors of the geomorphic signature are required at multiple scales. In this study, we present a new hyper-scale terrain analysis approach, referred to as Contextual Statistical Mapping (ConStat), which is based on statistical neighborhood measures derived for growing sparse circular neighborhoods. The statistical measures tested comprise basic descriptors such as the minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, and skewness, as well as statistical terrain attributes and directional components. We propose a data mining framework to determine the relevant statistical measures at the relevant scales to analyze and interpret the influence of these statistical measures and to map the geomorphic structures influencing soil formation and the regions where a statistical measure shows influence. We introduce ConStat on two landscape-scale DSM examples with different soil genesis regimes where the ConStat terrain features serve as proxies for multi-scale variations of climate and parent material conditions. The results show that ConStat provides high predictive power. The cross-validated R2 values range from 0.63 for predicting topsoil clay content in the Piracicaba area (Brazil) to 0.68 for topsoil silt content in the Rhine-Hesse area (Germany). The results obtained from data mining analysis allow for interpretations beyond conventional concepts and approaches to explain soil formation. As such it overcomes the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability of soil property predictions.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Applying a data mining tool used regularly in digital soil mapping, this research focuses on the optimal inclusion of predictors for soil–landscape modeling by utilizing as wide of a pool of variables as possible. Predictor variables for digital soil mapping are often chosen on the basis of data availability and the researcher's expert knowledge. Predictor variables commonly overlooked include alternative analysis scales for land-surface derivatives and additional remote sensing products. For this study, a pool of 412 potential predictors was assembled, which included qualitative location classes, elevation, land-surface derivatives (with a wide range of analysis scales), hydrologic indicators, as well as proximal and remote sensing (from multiple sources with a variety of resolutions). Subsets of the full pool were also examined for comparison. The performance for the models built from the different starting predictor pools was analyzed for seven target variables. Results suggest that models with limited predictor pools can substitute other predictors to compensate for the missing variables. However, a better performing model was always found by considering predictor variables at multiple scales. Compared with baseline subsets with the most commonly used predictors for digital soil mapping at a single scale, the use of multi-scale predictor variables produced an improvement in model performance ranging from negligible to a 70% increase in the adjusted R2. Although the scale effect of the modifiable area unit problem is generally well known, this study suggests digital soil mapping efforts would be enhanced by the greater consideration of predictor variables at multiple analysis scales.</td>

The user community requires training in, and experience with, the new digital soil map products, especially about the use of uncertainties for risk modelling and policy development. Standards are required for public and private sector digital soil map products to prevent the production of poor-quality information which will become misleading and counter-productive.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Background<br>The use of visible-near infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy for rapid soil characterisation has gained a lot of interest in recent times. Soil spectra absorbance from the visible-infrared range can be calibrated using regression models to predict a set of soil properties. The accuracy of these regression models relies heavily on the calibration set. The optimum sample size and the overall sample representativeness of the dataset could further improve the model performance. However, there is no guideline on which sampling method should be used under different size of datasets.<br><br>Methods<br>Here, we show different sampling algorithms performed differently under different data size and different regression models (Cubist regression tree and Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR)). We analysed the effect of three sampling algorithms: Kennard-Stone (KS), conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling (cLHS) and k-means clustering (KM) against random sampling on the prediction of up to five different soil properties (sand, clay, carbon content, cation exchange capacity and pH) on three datasets. These datasets have different coverages: a European continental dataset (LUCAS, n = 5,639), a regional dataset from Australia (Geeves, n = 379), and a local dataset from New South Wales, Australia (Hillston, n = 384). Calibration sample sizes ranging from 50 to 3,000 were derived and tested for the continental dataset; and from 50 to 200 samples for the regional and local datasets.<br><br>Results<br>Overall, the PLSR gives a better prediction in comparison to the Cubist model for the prediction of various soil properties. It is also less prone to the choice of sampling algorithm. The KM algorithm is more representative in the larger dataset up to a certain calibration sample size. The KS algorithm appears to be more efficient (as compared to random sampling) in small datasets; however, the prediction performance varied a lot between soil properties. The cLHS sampling algorithm is the most robust sampling method for multiple soil properties regardless of the sample size.<br><br>Discussion<br>Our results suggested that the optimum calibration sample size relied on how much generalization the model had to create. The use of the sampling algorithm is beneficial for larger datasets than smaller datasets where only small improvements can be made. KM is suitable for large datasets, KS is efficient in small datasets but results can be variable, while cLHS is less affected by sample size.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In theoretical pedology, the advantage of factor-process-properties models over factor-properties models has been confirmed for the understanding of soil genesis and its changes over time. Currently, the most frequently used model in digital soil mapping (DSM) is the SCORPAN model, which is based on the Dokuchaev-Jenny formula: soil properties are the result of the interactions among soil-forming factors over time. This work aims to incorporate processed-based modeling into DSM and investigate the use of a hydrological model to predict the soil spatial heterogeneity and simulate its spatiotemporal evolution over time in the Central Chernozem Reserve (East European Plain). Our approach, called the Nested Landscape Soil Triad: Factor-Process-Properties, is based on the subordination of soil processes to landscape processes and the nesting of the soil system into the landscape. Landscape processes result in specific landscape properties, which control the direction and intensity of soil-forming processes, and thus control soil properties. We hypothesize that, in the virgin steppe, the result of moisture redistribution via runoff along topography (landscape process) can be expressed quantitatively in the redistributed runoff value (landscape property) that controls the movement of salts within the soil profile (soil-forming processes) and soil taxa (soil properties). We directly linked a result of the landscape process and soil properties due to difficulties in soil-forming processes modeling. We conducted a prediction across the 35 ha study area using a 2.5 m digital elevation model (DEM) and 157 soil profile descriptions as input. The moisture redistribution process was simulated using SIMulated Water Erosion (SIMWE), implemented in open-access software (GRASS GIS). To define the optimal parameter combination for the SIMWE model, we performed multiparameter sensitivity test and optimization. We used Latin Hypercube sampling to generate the 3000 × 6 (the size of sample per number of parameters) parameter set for Monte Carlo ensemble runs within SIMWE. The maximum correspondence between the soil cover pattern and simulated flow depth was achieved with infiltration values of 0–10 mm h−1, Manning’s n of −0.3 to 1.0, water diffusion constant of −0.3 to 0.5, threshold water depth of −0.1 to 0.15 m, diffusion increase constant of −3 to 6, and precipitation excess rate of 60 mm h−1. The runoff redistribution values alone determine the carbonate depth in the soils (64% accuracy) and soil taxa (76% accuracy). Overall, the Nested Landscape Soil Triad: Factor-Process-Properties can explore how soil properties have changed and will change through time and identify areas with risks of soil taxa changes. The contradiction between the selected optimal precipitation excess and current climate prove the polygenetic formation of forest-steppe soils. This approach can be used to inform policymakers and large-scale management to ensure soil security.</td>

It is worth noting that in SNPs data, there is no knowledge of reports in the literature regarding the use of the KS method. For the construction and validation of the models, the partial least squares (PLS) estimation method and the Bayesian Lasso (BLASSO) proved to be more efficient for NIR data and for marker data SNPs, respectively. The evaluation of the predictive capacity of the models obtained after the data partition occurred through the correlation between the predicted and the observed values, and the corresponding square root of the mean squared error of prediction. For both datasets, results indicated that the results from KS and RS methods differ statistically from each other by the F test (P-value < 0.01). The KS method showed to be more efficient than RS in practically all repetitions. Also, KS method has the advantage of being easy and fast to be applied and also to select the same samples, which provides excellent benefits in the following analyses.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: At present, spatially very detailed data sets can be obtained about soil, landscape and crop variability. However, there is a need to select independent key properties to identify management classes needed for precise land management. In a previous study performed in the European loess belt, topsoil pH, apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) and elevation were identified as key properties. In this study we enlarged the number of soil properties by including gamma ray measurements and employed a similar methodology to a field in the sand belt of northern Europe. Based on a principal component analysis we identified the same three variables as key properties. This was surprising given the big differences in landscape topology and pedogenesis between the loess and sand areas. These three key variables were used to delineate management classes using a fuzzy k-means with extragrade classification procedure. This classification was evaluated by mapping the wheat grain yield in the year 2006. A multiple regression model could be constructed that predicted yield from ECa and elevation well (Radj2 = 0.88). To analyse the influence of ECa on crop yield in depth a boundary line analysis was conducted. The boundary line could be modelled with an excellent Radj2 of 0.98. It was concluded that ECa, elevation and pH are generic key variables for the delineation of management classes of the aeolian landscapes of north–west Europe. Given its integral nature and strong relationship with crop performances, the authors plea to upgrade ECa from a “secondary” (proxy) source of information to a “primary” variable which can be used directly as a basis for detailed soil mapping of the bulk soil.</td>

Legacy soil survey maps are often used as a covariate for updating soil surveys because such soil survey maps are logically assumed to contain significant information about the spatial distribution of soil classes. In the present study the usefulness of including conventional soil survey maps as a DSM covariate was investigated. Random forest and multinomial logistic regression models were built using two different covariate sets: covariate set 1 included the legacy soil survey, covariate set 2 excluded the soil survey. Soil Great Groups, Subgroups, and Series taxonomic classes were modeled using both models and covariate sets for an area of &nbsp; 85,000 ha in Golestan Province, northern Iran. Overall model accuracy, the Kappa statistic, and individual covariate importances were used to assess the influence of including the legacy soil survey.<br><br>Including the conventional soil map as covariate generally increased model accuracy, but the improvement in model accuracy was surprisingly small at all taxonomic levels. This may be due to soil change or the mapping scale of the legacy soil survey. Random forests was found to be more accurate than multinomial logistic regression at all taxonomic levels. Multinomial logistic regression models at the soil Series level were less accurate than the legacy soil survey.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The application of machine learning (ML) techniques in various fields of science has increased rapidly, especially in the last 10 years. The increasing availability of soil data that can be efficiently acquired remotely and proximally, and freely available open-source algorithms, have led to an accelerated adoption of ML techniques to analyse soil data. Given the large number of publications, it is an impossible task to manually review all papers on the application of ML in soil science without narrowing down a narrative of ML application in a specific research question. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the application of ML techniques in soil science aided by a ML algorithm (latent Dirichlet allocation) to find patterns in a large collection of text corpora. The objective is to gain insight into publications of ML applications in soil science and to discuss the research gaps in this topic. We found that (a) there is an increasing usage of ML methods in soil sciences, mostly concentrated in developed countries, (b) the reviewed publications can be grouped into 12 topics, namely remote sensing, soil organic carbon, water, contamination, methods (ensembles), erosion and parent material, methods (NN, neural networks, SVM, support vector machines), spectroscopy, modelling (classes), crops, physical, and modelling (continuous), and (c) advanced ML methods usually perform better than simpler approaches thanks to their capability to capture non-linear relationships. From these findings, we found research gaps, in particular, about the precautions that should be taken (parsimony) to avoid overfitting, and that the interpretability of the ML models is an important aspect to consider when applying advanced ML methods in order to improve our knowledge and understanding of soil. We foresee that a large number of studies will focus on the latter topic.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The uptake of machine learning (ML) algorithms in digital soil mapping (DSM) is transforming the way soil scientists produce their maps. Within the past two decades, soil scientists have applied ML to a wide range of scenarios, by mapping soil properties or classes with various ML algorithms, on spatial scale from the local to the global, and with depth. The wide adoption of ML for soil mapping was made possible by the increase in data availability, the ease of accessing environmental spatial data, and the development of software solutions aided by computational tools to analyse them. In this article, we review the current use of ML in DSM, identify the key challenges and suggest solutions from the existing literature. There is a growing interest in the use of ML in DSM. Most studies emphasize prediction and accuracy of the predicted maps for applications, such as baseline production of quantitative soil information. Few studies account for existing soil knowledge in the modelling process or quantify the uncertainty of the predicted maps. Further, we discuss the challenges related to the application of ML for soil mapping and suggest solutions from existing studies in the natural sciences. The challenges are: sampling, resampling, accounting for the spatial information, multivariate mapping, uncertainty analysis, validation, integration of pedological knowledge and interpretation of the models. Overall, the current literature shows few attempts in understanding the underlying soil structure or process using the predicted maps and the ML model, for example by generating hypotheses on mechanistic relationships among variables. In this regard, several additional challenging aspects need to be considered, such as the inclusion of pedological knowledge in the ML algorithm or the interpretability of the calibrated ML model. Tackling these challenges is critical for ML to gain credibility and scientific consistency in soil science. We conclude that for future developments, ML could incorporate three core elements: plausibility, interpretability, and explainability, which will trigger soil scientists to couple model prediction with pedological explanation and understanding of the underlying soil processes.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The spatial prediction of soil attributes plays important roles in establishing areas for agricultural development and sustainable land management. This paper aimed to model and map various soil properties (i.e. texture, pH, and soil organic matter content) at a spatial resolution of 90 m across a 21 million-ha. area in Eastern China using 2895 legacy topsoil observations coupled with freely available covariates (i.e. DEM, Landsat, Climate and Radar data). A decision tree model (Cubist) and a Regression Kriging (RK) approach were used in the modelling process. The prediction results showed that the RK approach achieved high accuracy in predicting the spatial distributions of soil properties that were affected by human activities (i.e. soil pH and organic matter content). Moreover, DEM data decomposed to different spatial scales and climate factors were found to be the most important predictors in this study area. It was concluded that the current methodology can be readily expanded to the whole China using existing soil data as a contribution to the GlobalSoilMap project.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: A neural network model was trained to predict soil organic matter content, bulk density and soil organic matter density at different soil profile depths across Scotland. These predictions were then used to predict soil organic carbon content. The data used to train the model was developed from the National Soil Inventory of Scotland (NSIS) datasets, along with spatial datasets for topographic and climatic variables, and for geology, soil type and land cover. The trained network was tested and found to explain 79.8% of the variance in organic matter content, 77.9% of the variance in bulk density and 57.3% of the variance in profile depth. Various statistical measures were used to evaluate the predictive ability of the model, showing that it was suitable for predicting the carbon stocks of soils. The neural network model was used to make predictions from the surface to 1 m in 1 cm intervals, at 100 m spatial resolution, across Scotland. This allowed us to make a prediction of the distribution, spatially and at depth, of carbon stocks to 1 m across Scotland and to make estimates of the total carbon stock of Scottish soils (2954 Tg) and the amount stored in different soil types across the country. We found that our estimate of the amount of carbon stored in Scottish soils was in agreement with previous estimates. Mineral and organo-mineral soils are predicted to hold a large amount of carbon in the upper portion, and in terms of carbon stock are almost as important as peat soils. At increased depth, a much smaller proportion of the total Scottish soil carbon stock is held in soils not classified as organic. We provide information about the distribution of carbon stocks with depth and soil type and under different land use/land cover types. Finally, we discuss the relevance of this information in relation to efforts to store carbon within Scottish soils in the medium to long term.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Planning sustainable use of land resources requires reliable information about spatial distribution of soil physical and chemical properties related to environmental processes and ecosystemic functions. In this context, cation exchange capacity (CEC) is a fundamental soil quality indicator; however, it takes money and time to obtain this data. Although many studies have been conducted to spatially quantify soil properties on various scales and in different environments, not much is known about interactions between soil properties and environmental covariates in the Brazilian semiarid region. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of random forest and cokriging models applied to predict CEC in the Brazilian semiarid region. The covariates used to predict CEC consist of images from Landsat 5 TM and a legacy soil map (scale 1:10,000). The sample set comprises 499 samples from the topsoil layer (0.00-0.20 m), where 375 samples were used in training processes and 124 as validation samples. The cokriging model (R2 = 0.57 and RMSE = 7.22 cmolc kg-1) performed better in predicting CEC than the random forest model (R2 = 0.47 and RMSE = 7.89 cmolc kg-1). The approach used showed potential for estimating CEC content in the Brazilian semiarid region by using covariates obtained from orbital remote sensing and the legacy soil map.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Spatial 3-D information on soil hydraulic properties for areas larger than plot scale is usually derived using indirect methods such as pedotransfer functions (PTFs) due to the lack of measured information on them. PTFs describe the relationship between the desired soil hydraulic parameter and easily available soil properties based on a soil hydraulic reference dataset. Soil hydraulic properties of a catchment or region can be calculated by applying PTFs on available soil maps. Our aim was to analyse the performance of (i) indirect (using PTFs) and (ii) direct (geostatistical) mapping methods to derive 3-D soil hydraulic properties. The study was performed on the Balaton catchment area in Hungary, where density of measured soil hydraulic data fulfils the requirements of geostatistical methods. Maps of saturated water content (0 cm matric potential), field capacity (−330 cm matric potential) and wilting point (−15 000 cm matric potential) for 0–30, 30–60 and 60–90 cm soil depth were prepared. PTFs were derived using the random forest method on the whole Hungarian soil hydraulic dataset, which includes soil chemical, physical, taxonomical and hydraulic properties of some 12 000 samples complemented with information on topography, climate, parent material, vegetation and land use. As a direct and thus geostatistical method, random forest combined with kriging (RFK) was applied to 359 soil profiles located in the Balaton catchment area. There were no significant differences between the direct and indirect methods in six out of nine maps having root-mean-square-error values between 0.052 and 0.074 cm3 cm−3, which is in accordance with the internationally accepted performance of hydraulic PTFs. The PTF-based mapping method performed significantly better than the RFK for the saturated water content at 30–60 and 60–90 cm soil depth; in the case of wilting point the RFK outperformed the PTFs at 60–90 cm depth. Differences between the PTF-based and RFK mapped values are less than 0.025 cm3 cm−3 for 65 %–86  % of the catchment. In RFK, the uncertainty of input environmental covariate layers is less influential on the mapped values, which is preferable. In the PTF-based method the uncertainty of mapping soil hydraulic properties is less computationally intensive. Detailed comparisons of maps derived from the PTF-based method and the RFK are presented in this paper.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Assessment of soil organic carbon stocks (SOCs) is highly relevant considering that SOCs is the central driver in climate change mitigation and soil fertility. In Madagascar, a first attempt at mapping SOCs on a national scale was undertaken in 2009 with previous soil data. Advanced research on soil carbon mapping on a global scale is required to enable better land use decisions. This study aims to (i) evaluate the drivers of soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in the first 30 cm soil layer on a national scale from spatially explicit explanatory environmental variables and a recent soil database and (ii) update the spatial distribution of SOCs at this scale through digital mapping. A spatial model was established using randomForest, a decision tree algorithm and based on 10 pedoclimatic, topographic, and vegetation variables. The model was developed with 1993 available soil plot data (collected from 2010 to 2015) and their environmental information (“VALSOL-Madagascar” database). These data were divided into two sets: a first set (n = 835) used for model calibration and a second set (n = 358) for external validation. Results showed that mean annual temperature (MAT, °C), mean annual precipitation (MAP, mm), elevation (m) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were the most important predictors of SOCs. The retained prediction model had a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) equal to 25.8 MgC·ha− 1. The predicted SOCs from fitted models ranged from 28 to 198 MgC·ha− 1 with total SOCs to 4137 TgC. Depending on soil type, Ferralsols (35 to 165 MgC·ha− 1) and Andosols (48 to 198 MgC·ha− 1) had relevant results related to the number of soil profiles (n = 856 and 171 respectively). Despite the need for in-depth analysis, the model and map produced in the present study has greatly improved our knowledge of the spatial distribution of SOCs in Madagascar and reduced uncertainty compared to the former map. This map provides new perspectives in sustainable land management in Madagascar.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Soil maps are important to evaluate soil functions and support decision-making process, particularly for soil properties such as pH, carbon content (C), and cation exchange capacity (CEC), but the spatial resolution and soil depth should meet the needs of users. On another hand, the efficiency of statistical models to create soil maps, with an acceptable level of accuracy, often require a large number of samples with an appropriate distribution across the area of interest. However, accessibility for sampling can be a trouble in remote areas, such as the Itatiaia National Park (INP). The hypothesis of this work is that it is possible to obtain a viable result in soil mapping of areas with limited access by using DSM tools. The general objective of this paper was to create 2- and 3-D maps of the soil properties pH, carbon content, and CEC, with the correspondent spatial uncertainty, in the INP plateau. The sampling strategy was designed using conditioned Latin Hypercube Sample (cLHS), and different methods were tested to produce the soil properties maps. For calibration of the models: linear (MLR, multiple linear regression) and nonlinear (GAM, Generalised Additive Models). The results showed differences in predictive performance for all statistical methods and covariate selection approaches. The GAM, with covariates selection based on soil formation factors, was the best method for the limited number of soil samples. The greatest uncertainty was associated with areas with the lowest accessibility and, consequently, with low sampling density and/or noises in covariates. Even though the 2- and 3-D maps of soil properties, each associated with explicit uncertainty, can contribute to the INP decision makers/managers by providing information not available before.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: 80% of arable land in Africa has low soil fertility and suffers from physical soil problems. Additionally, significant amounts of nutrients are lost every year due to unsustainable soil management practices. This is partially the result of insufficient use of soil management knowledge. To help bridge the soil information gap in Africa, the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) project was established in 2008. Over the period 2008–2014, the AfSIS project compiled two point data sets: the Africa Soil Profiles (legacy) database and the AfSIS Sentinel Site database. These data sets contain over 28 thousand sampling locations and represent the most comprehensive soil sample data sets of the African continent to date. Utilizing these point data sets in combination with a large number of covariates, we have generated a series of spatial predictions of soil properties relevant to the agricultural management—organic carbon, pH, sand, silt and clay fractions, bulk density, cation-exchange capacity, total nitrogen, exchangeable acidity, Al content and exchangeable bases (Ca, K, Mg, Na). We specifically investigate differences between two predictive approaches: random forests and linear regression. Results of 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate that the random forests algorithm consistently outperforms the linear regression algorithm, with average decreases of 15–75% in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) across soil properties and depths. Fitting and running random forests models takes an order of magnitude more time and the modelling success is sensitive to artifacts in the input data, but as long as quality-controlled point data are provided, an increase in soil mapping accuracy can be expected. Results also indicate that globally predicted soil classes (USDA Soil Taxonomy, especially Alfisols and Mollisols) help improve continental scale soil property mapping, and are among the most important predictors. This indicates a promising potential for transferring pedological knowledge from data rich countries to countries with limited soil data.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Knowledge, data, and understanding of soils is key for advancing agriculture and society. There is currently a critical need for sustainable soil management tools for enhanced food security on Native American Tribal Lands. Tribal Reservations have basic soil information and limited access to conservation programs provided to other U.S producers. The objective of this study was to create first ever high-resolution digital soil property maps of Quapaw Tribal Lands with limited data for sustainable soil resource management. We used a digital soil mapping (DSM) approach based on fuzzy logic to model the spatial distribution of 24 soil properties at 0–15 and 15–30 cm depths. A digital elevation model with 3 m resolution was used to derive terrain variables and a total of 28 samples were collected at 0–30 cm over the 22,880-ha reservation. Additionally, soil property maps were derived from Gridded Soil Survey Geographic Database (gSSURGO) for comparison. When comparing properties modeled by DSM to those derived from gSSURGO, DSM resulted in lower root mean squared error (RMSE) for percent clay and sand at 0–15 cm, and cation exchange capacity, percent clay, and pH at 15–30 cm. Conversely, gSSURGO-derived maps resulted in lower RMSE for cation exchange capacity, pH, and percent silt at the 0–15 cm depth, and percent sand and silt at the 15–30 cm depth. Although, some of the soil properties derived from gSSURGO had lower RMSE, spatial soil property patterns modeled by DSM were in better agreement with the topographic complexity and expected soil-landscape relationships. The proposed DSM approach developed property maps at high-resolution, which sets the baseline for production of new spatial soil information for Quapaw Tribal soils. It is expected that these maps and future versions will be useful for soil, crop, and land-use decisions at the farm and Tribal-level for increased agricultural productivity and economic development. Overall, this study provides a framework for developing DSM on Tribal Lands for improving the accuracy and detail of soil property maps (relative to off the shelf products such as SSURGO) that better represents soil-forming environments and the spatial variability of soil properties on Tribal Lands.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Current digital soil mapping (DSM) methods have limitations. For instance, it is difficult to predict a large number of soil properties simultaneously, while preserving the relationships between them. Another problem is that prevalent prediction models use pedological knowledge in a very crude way only. To tackle these problems, we investigated the use of structural equation modelling (SEM). SEM has its roots in the social sciences and is recently also being used in other scientific disciplines, such as ecology. SEM integrates empirical information with mechanistic knowledge by deriving the model equations from known causal relationships, while estimating the model parameters using the available data. It distinguishes between endogenous and exogenous variables, where, in our application, the first are soil properties and the latter are external soil forming factors (i.e. climate, relief, organisms). We introduce SEM theory and present a case study in which we applied SEM to a 22,900 km 2 region in the Argentinian Pampas to map seven key soil properties. In this case study, we started with identifying the main soil forming processes in the study area and assigned for each process the main soil properties affected. Based on this analysis we defined a conceptual soil-landscape model, which was subsequently converted to a SEM graphical model. Finally, we derived the SEM equations and implemented these in the statistical software R using the latent variable analysis (lavaan) package. The model was calibrated using a soil dataset of 320 soil profile data and 12 environmental covariate layers. The outcomes of the model were maps of seven soil properties and a SEM graph that shows the strength of the relationships. Although the accuracy of the maps, based on cross-validation and independent validation, was poor, this paper demonstrates that SEM can be used to explicitly include pedological knowledge in prediction of soil properties and modelling of their interrelationships. It bridges the gap between empirical and mechanistic methods for soil-landscape modelling, and is a tool that can help produce pedologically sound soil maps.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Efficient modelling methods to assess soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks have a pivotal importance as inputs for global carbon cycle studies and decision-making processes. However, laboratory analyses of SOC field samples are costly and time consuming. Global-scale estimates of SOC were recently made according to categorical variables, including land use and soil texture. Remote sensing (RS) data can contribute to the better modelling of the spatial distribution of SOC stock at a regional scale. In the present study, we used Stochastic Gradient Treeboost (SGT) to estimate the topsoil (0–30 cm) SOC stock of a Mediterranean semiarid area (Sicily, Italy, 25,286 km2). In particular, our study examined agricultural lands, which represent approximately 64% of the entire region. An extensive soil dataset (2202 samples, 1 profile/7.31 km2 on average) was acquired from the soil database of Sicily. The georeferenced field observations were intersected with remotely sensed environmental data and other spatial data, including climatic data from WORLDCLIM, land cover from CORINE, soil texture, topography and derived indices. Finally, the SGT was compared to published global estimates (GSOC) and data from the International Soil Reference and Information Centre (ISRIC) Soil Grids by comparing the pseudo-regressions of the SGT, GSOC and ISRIC with soil observations. The mean SOC stock across the entire region that was estimated by GSOC and ISRIC was 3.9% lower and 46.2% higher compared to the SGT. The SGT efficiently predicted SOC stocks that were < 70 t ha− 1 (corresponding to the 90th percentile of the observed values). On average, the coefficient of variation of the SGT model was 3.6% when computed on the whole dataset and remained lower than 23% when computed on a distribution basis. The SGT mean absolute error was 14.84 t ha− 1, 18.4% and 36.3% lower than GSOC and ISRIC, respectively. The mean annual rainfall, soil texture, land use, mean annual temperature and Landsat 7 ETM+ panchromatic Band 8 were the most important predictors of SOC stock. Finally, SOC stocks were estimated for each land cover class. SGT predicted SOC stock better than GSOC and ISRIC for most data. This resulted in a percentage of data in the prediction confidence interval ± 50% compared to the observed values of 71.4%, 65.8%, and 50.7% for SGT, GSOC, and SGT, respectively. This consisted of a higher R2 and a slope (β) that was closer to 1 for the pseudo-regression constructed with SGT compared to GSOC and ISRIC. In conclusion, the results of the present study showed that the integration of RS with climatic and soil texture spatial data could strongly improve SOC prediction in a semi-arid Mediterranean region. In addition, the panchromatic band of Landsat 7 ETM + was more predictive compared to the conventionally used NDVI. This information is crucial to guiding decision-making processes, especially at a regional scale and/or in semi-arid Mediterranean areas. The model performance of the SGT could be further improved by adopting predictors with greater spatial resolutions. The results of the present experiment yield valuable information, especially for assessing climate change or land use change scenarios for SOC stocks and their spatial distribution.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: El objetivo de este estudio fue evaluar el desempeño del método de muestreo denominado hipercubo latino condicionado (cLHS) para identificar sitios convenientes para la obtención de datos de propiedades edáficas, que son usados en la construcción de modelos para el mapeo digital de una variable espacialmente distribuida, como es el carbono orgánico del suelo (COS). Dados N sitios con información sobre p variables explicativas (X), cLHS selecciona una muestra de n sitios de tal manera que la distribución multivariada de X sea completamente caracterizada. En este trabajo, se utilizaron datos de un estudio regional de suelos de la Provincia de Córdoba para comparar el desempeño del método de muestreo cLHS con el muestreo aleatorio simple (MAS). Para evaluar el método de muestreo, se muestreó repetidamente la población de sitios con datos y se ajustó, en cada muestra, la relación entre COS y las propiedades edafo-climáticas del sitio, usando tanto modelos de regresión lineal como el algoritmo random forest de aprendizaje automático. Se evaluaron los errores de predicción de cada método de muestreo con cada método estadístico usado para la predicción de COS en sitios donde esta variable no fue medida. El método de muestreo impactó la confiabilidad global de las predicciones derivadas de ambos modelos de regresión y los errores de predicción sitio-específicos. El método cLHS fue más eficiente que MAS para identificar sitios con suficiente variabilidad para estimar el modelo de la relación entre COS y propiedades edafo-climáticas, usado para predecir en otros sitios del territorio el valor del COS. El modelo estimado puede ser usado para mapeo digital de COS.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: SDBm Plus: FAO-CSIC Multilingual Soil Profile Database is a derivative from the SDBm database (FAO-ISRIC-CSIC, World Soil Resources Reports 81, 1995) which has been developed by CSIC/IRNAS with the collaboration of FAO/AGLL through a joint project (Letter of Agreement PR 15621, 7.12.1999), during 1999 and 2000. The initial version of SDBm was the SDB database (FAO-ISRIC, World Soil Resources Reports 64, 1989). As its predecessors, SDBm Plus is an ‘open’ system which can be modified in the future. SDBm Plus has been totally re-designed and re-written as a WINDOWS application. It is a user-friendly software designed to harmonise, store and use large amounts of geo-referenced soil profile data, elaborated in the field and the laboratory, in an efficient and systematic way. The soil profile database can be utilised regardless of scale, at regional, national or local level, in soil monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E). The main characteristics of this database are the following: i) software development for WINDOWS platforms; ii) multilingual function and automatic translation from English, as source language, to other target languages (so far Spanish, French and German); iii) detailed soil profile characterisation following the conventional procedures of soil survey, making use of ‘assist menus’ in the selected language which greatly facilitates data storage; iv) possibility of monitoring the temporal variability of analytical, physical and hydraulic soil properties; v) metabase facility to describe the methods used in the laboratory analysis; and vi) interface facility to automatize the linkage of soil data to computerised information systems.</td>

Con la finalidad de predecir la variación de las clases de fertilidad del suelo se combinaron dos técnicas alternativas de análisis espacial. La primera técnica corresponde a la utilización del análisis geoestadístico para la interpolación de propiedades individuales del suelo de naturaleza química y física.<br>La segunda técnica consistió en la aplicación de un sistema de clasificación no supervisado basado en la teoría de conjuntos difusos mediante el algoritmo FCM (c-medias difuso), para la generación de un modelo digital de clases de fertilidad del suelo. Para tal fin, se realizó un muestreo superficial en 110 sitios en terrenos del Campo Experimental “El Rastro”, sector El Rastro, municipio Francisco de Mirandaestado Guárico (Venezuela). Se analizaron diez variables del suelo: pH, conductividad eléctrica, materia orgánica, fósforo disponible, potasio asimilable, calcio y magnesio disponible, y las cantidades relativas de arena, limo y arcilla. Las variables medidas fueron interpoladas en cada punto de muestreo utilizando kriging ordinario y ajustadas mediante semivariogramas teóricos. Se utilizó un método inductivo para la obtención de las clases de fertilidad del suelo, y se obtuvo un modelo de clases de suelo basado en la integración de las variables. La confiabilidad de los mapas individuales de cada variable del suelo se realizó mediante validación cruzada, para corroborar la capacidad predictiva de las variables se aplicó un análisis de varianza, y para la valoración del modelo final se empleó estadística multivariada. El mapa digital de fertilidad indicó que en el área de estudio predominan siete clases de fertilidad, las cuales presentaron una confiabilidad superior al 85%, lo que indicó un alto grado de homogeneidad dentro de las clases de suelo definidas.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Digital soil mapping (DSM) was used to generate soil property surfaces at 30 m resolution for Tasmanian Government Land Suitability Modelling in Tasmania, Australia. Soil predictions were required for pH, EC, clay percentage, stone content, drainage, and depth to sodic and impeding layer. Empirical modelling using a suite of environmental covariates and the relevant soil attribute data from field-collected soil cores was used to generate the digital maps. Environmental covariates included: SRTM DEM and derivatives, gamma radiometry, legacy soil maps, surface geology, and multi-spectral satellite imagery.<br><br>An integral component of any DSM process is a sound sampling design that represents the full range of environmental variables used. However, in cases where there are operational constraints, the approach needs to remain flexible, efficient, and compatible with project area land use and terrain. In two separate study areas, a combined 700 training and 230 validation sites were sampled over 70,000 ha. A conditioned Latin hypercube (cLHS) sampling design was used for the initial sampling for DSM training sites, with ‘contingency sites’ created for alternative sampling if access was constrained. The pre-defined (‘strict’) sample locations proved difficult to implement in the field, with a variety of access issues making sampling slow and arduous. In an attempt to increase sampling progress rates to meet tight project milestones an alternative ‘relaxed’ sample design based on random sampling of fuzzy k-means covariate clusters (strata) was used for the second study area. A map of clusters provided to soil sampling staff allowed difficult sites to be relocated within the same cluster type, maintaining stratification. The relaxed approach still adequately represented the covariate distribution while providing greater flexibility to site placement. This paper provides background to the Tasmanian DSM project, some discussion of sampling designs for DSM, and the pros and cons of their implementation in the field with due consideration of operational constraints in a Tasmanian case study, highlighting the need for sampling flexibility within ‘real-world’ conditions.</td>

We propose considering the soil sampling procedure as a task of optimal design. In practical terms, optimal experiments can reduce experimentation costs, as they allow the researcher to obtain one optimal set of points. We present a sampling design, based on the fundamental idea of selecting sample locations by performing an optimal design method called the maxvol algorithm. It is shown that the maxvol-base algorithm has a high potential for practical usage. Our method outperforms popular sampling methods in soil taxa prediction based on topographical features of the site and deals with massive agricultural datasets in a reasonable time.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Over the last decades extensive work has been done on sampling optimization. Many of the related papers focused on the optimization of sampling for only one soil property. However, there is a necessity to prepare a sampling strategy which is optimized for multivariate digital soil mapping (DSM) purposes. The aim of our work was to elaborate a sampling optimization methodology for multivariate DSM considering the demands on economic efficiency. We presented and tested it through a real-time survey at Tokaj Wine Region, Hungary. The soil properties of interest were pH, soil organic matter (SOM), and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) content. The end-users defined the minimal requested precision for the DSM products (in terms of the average range of the 90% prediction interval), and priority areas on which more detailed survey was requested. We planned a two-phase soil survey based on regression kriging (RK). The results from the first-phase sampling were used to parameterize the second-phase sampling in which spatial simulated annealing (SSA) was applied. The spatially averaged range of the 90% prediction interval was the pre-survey quality measure which can be readily derived from the RK variance. The workflow can be summarized as follows: (1) rank the soil properties considering their spatial variabilities, and precision requests, (2) optimize the sampling design by SSA for the dominant soil property, (3) optimize the sampling by the invers application of SSA for the next soil property using the optimized design from the previous step, and (4) repeat the previous step until all soil property are being selected. In our case, SOM was the dominant property. According to the plot of the sample size vs. quality measure, the optimized design with 500 samples will ensure the minimal requested precision for the SOM map (i.e. 0.5%). In the next step, the optimal removal of those sampling points was targeted which have less information content. In the cases of pH and CaCO3, 100 and 175 could be removed from the 500 samples, and the remaining 400 and 325 samples will ensure the requested precision for the pH (i.e. 1.2) and CaCO3 (i.e. 5%) maps. We computed the relative sampling density on priority and non-priority areas for each sampling designs which showed that densities on priority areas were at least 1.5 times higher than on non-priority areas. We could conclude that the methodology is able to optimize the sampling design for multivariate DSM purposes considering numerous sampling constraints such as the predefined precision, priority areas, and economic efficiency.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Predicting taxonomic classes can be challenging with dataset subject to substantial irregularities due to the involvement of many surveyors. A data pruning approach was used in the present study to reduce such source errors by exploring whether different data pruning methods, which result in different subsets of a major reference soil groups (RSG) – the Plinthosols – would lead to an increase in prediction accuracy of the minor soil groups by using Random Forest (RF). This method was compared to the random oversampling approach. Four datasets were used, including the entire dataset and the pruned dataset, which consisted of 80% and 90% respectively, and standard deviation core range of the Plinthosols data while cutting off all data points belonging to the outer range. The best prediction was achieved when RF was used with recursive feature elimination along with the non-oversampled 90% core range dataset. This model provided a substantial agreement to observation, with a kappa value of 0.57 along with 7% to 35% increase in prediction accuracy for smaller RSG. The reference soil groups in the Dano catchment appeared to be mainly influenced by the wetness index, a proxy for soil moisture distribution.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Soil texture is a physical property of soil and knowledge on its spatial distribution is essential for many agricultural and environmental activities especially in alluvial plains. This study aimed to predict the spatial distribution of soil fractions (i.e. percentages of sand, silt, and clay) in Sistan floodplain on a regional scale (area: 1500 km2). Random forest (RF), regression kriging-neural network residual kriging (RKNNRK), neural network residual kriging (NNRK), regression kriging (RK), and cokriging (COK) methods were used to map soil texture components over the region. Soil fractions were measured for 160 soil samples taken from the surface layer (0–30 cm) of various soil series in agriculture land of Sistan floodplain. The additive log-ratio (alr) transformation was applied to transform texture components prior to prediction. Remote sensing data including Landsat 8′ Bands (1–8), Band 4 to Band 8 ratio, Band 4 to Band 3 ratio, NDVI, GSI, Brightness Index, and Clay Index were used as auxiliary variables for interpolation of soil fractions. 80% of actual data was used for prediction and 20% of data was used for validation. The performance of methods used was evaluated using RMSE, ME and MAE criteria. The results showed that the RKNNRK model has the highest accuracy for prediction of sand (RMSE = 15.04%) and clay (RMSE = 8.77%) contents while the most accurate model for predicting silt content is NNRK (RMSE = 12.68%). RK and COK performed worse than NNRK and RKNNRK. A relatively high value of RMSE obtained for sand (17.89%), silt (14.15%), and clay (8.89%) contents by the RF model. This could be due to the low relief of study area, regional scale effects, low density of sampling points and high heterogeneity of soil texture components in floodplains. Our findings revealed that RKNNRK and NNRK models, when combined with remote sensing data, produce more accurate results and therefore can be used for appropriate mapping of soil fractions in floodplains and on a regional scale.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The status of the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock at any position in the landscape is subject to a complex interplay of soil state factors operating at different scales and regulating multiple processes resulting either in soils acting as a net sink or net source of carbon. Forest landscapes are characterized by high spatial variability, and key drivers of SOC stock might be specific for sub-areas compared to those influencing the whole landscape. Consequently, separately calibrating models for sub-areas (local models) that collectively cover a target area can result in different prediction accuracy and SOC stock drivers compared to a single model (global model) that covers the whole area. The goal of this study was therefore to (1) assess how global and local models differ in predicting the humus layer, mineral soil, and total SOC stock in Swedish forests and (2) identify the key factors for SOC stock prediction and their scale of influence.<br><br>We used the Swedish National Forest Soil Inventory (NFSI) database and a digital soil mapping approach to evaluate the prediction performance using random forest models calibrated locally for the northern, central, and southern Sweden (local models) and for the whole of Sweden (global model). Models were built by considering (1) only site characteristics which are recorded on the plot during the NFSI, (2) the group of covariates (remote sensing, historical land use data, etc.) and (3) both site characteristics and group of covariates consisting mostly of remote sensing data.<br><br>Local models were generally more effective for predicting SOC stock after testing on independent validation data. Using the group of covariates together with NFSI data indicated that such covariates have limited predictive strength but that site-specific covariates from the NFSI showed better explanatory strength for SOC stocks. The most important covariates that influence the humus layer, mineral soil (0–50 cm), and total SOC stock were related to the site-characteristic covariates and include the soil moisture class, vegetation type, soil type, and soil texture. This study showed that local calibration has the potential to improve prediction accuracy, which will vary depending on the type of available covariates.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Due to confounding factors such as crop residue and soil moisture, soil organic matter (SOM) is usually estimated from soil samples in a laboratory or in the field at a local scale. In this study, laboratory and field data of crop residue, soil moisture, crop management practices, and SOM content were used in concert with multi-temporal MODIS images captured during bare soil periods over three years to construct spectral indices, which were then used as input variables to build a regional-scale SOM prediction model. Results showed that: (1) multi-temporal satellite images can be used to predict SOM content at a regional scale; (2) crop residue cover and time interval between snow melt, rainfall, and ploughing determined the optimal input variables for SOM prediction; (3) compared to a SOM model based on a single image, a multi-temporal model reduced the influence of soil moisture and improved both the stability and the accuracy of SOM prediction; (4) the best models generally used the ratio of MODIS Band 6 and Band 1 (R61) as an input variable, as R61 showed good correlation with SOM and less correlation with moisture; and (5) comparing different models in different years showed that models performed better in years with less crop residue. The study results can be used to improve the accuracy of quantitative estimates of the soil organic carbon pool and provide assistance in digital soil mapping.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Soils of semi-arid climates undergo organic carbon loss, which in turn affects their agricultural potential. Geostatistics is often used as an interpolation tool to thoroughly describe SOC spatial distribution. To focus on soil organic carbon (SOC) depletion, the Tiffech watershed (Northeast of Algeria), an economically important agricultural area, was chosen due to intensive agricultural practices, decline of forests and occurrence of erosion. The present study aimed to predict the spatial variation of SOC in Tiffech watershed using geostatistics and a Geographical Information System (GIS) software, comparing the performance of two geostatistical methods—Ordinary Kriging (OK) and Regression Kriging (RK)—also assessing the role of auxiliary variables in improving the prediction accuracy and highlighting the role of land cover in SOC storage. The SOC content in Tiffech soils was determined on 42 soil samples from the surface layer (0–10 cm) collected all over the study area and the results were used to estimate SOC density in non-sampled locations. The prediction efficiency of the two methods was evaluated by calculating the Mean Error (ME), the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Root Mean Square Standardized Error (RMSSE). The interpolation results showed that SOC distribution in the study area was correlated to the topography, the clay index, and general landscape features. SOC content increased northwards in the area, ranging from 0.53 to 6.9 kg·m−2 in relation to land use. As expected, maps figured a good conservation status of SOC stocks in areas with dense vegetation; conversely poor SOC contents were estimated where land degradation factors take place. Cross-validation results showed an outperformance in the interpolation accuracy of RK on OK after the introduction of environmental variables, with an RMSE value of 0.02 versus 0.81. This suggests a higher efficiency of RK in predicting SOC content across the Tiffech area in comparison with OK, confirming that introducing some auxiliary data correlated to the target variable in SOC estimation, considerably improved the interpolation accuracy.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Soil thickness (ST) is a crucial factor in earth surface modelling and soil storage capacity calculations (e.g., available water capacity and carbon stocks). However, the observed depths recorded in soil information systems for some profiles are often less than the actual ST (i.e., right censored data). The use of such data will negatively affect model and map accuracy, yet few studies have been done to resolve this issue or propose methods to correct for right censored data. Therefore, this work demonstrates how right censored data can be accounted for in the ST modelling of mainland France. We propose the use of Random Survival Forest (RSF) for ST probability mapping within a Digital Soil Mapping framework. Among 2109 sites of the French Soil Monitoring Network, 1089 observed STs were defined as being right censored. Using RSF, the probability of exceeding a given depth was modelled using freely available spatial data representing the main soil-forming factors. Subsequently, the models were extrapolated to the full spatial extent of mainland France. As examples, we produced maps showing the probability of exceeding the thickness of each GlobalSoilMap standard depth: 5, 15, 30, 60, 100, and 200 cm. In addition, a bootstrapping approach was used to assess the 90% confidence intervals. Our results showed that RSF was able to correct for right censored data entries occurring within a given dataset. RSF was more reliable for thin (0.3 m) and thick soils (1 to 2 m), as they performed better (overall accuracy from 0.793 to 0.989) than soils with a thickness between 0.3 and 1 m. This study provides a new approach for modelling right censored soil information. Moreover, RSF can produce probability maps at any depth less than the maximum depth of the calibration data, which is of great value for designing additional sampling campaigns and decision making in geotechnical engineering.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The article analyzes the problems of modern soil mapping and offers a new, interdisciplinary approach to overcoming them. Among these problems, the most noticeable are the following: harmonization and thematic content of soil maps, multiscale soil mapping, and global soil map. It is shown that the main reasons of problems in modern soil mapping are the recognition of the priority of the practical purposes of soil mapping over the scientific ones, the lack of understanding of the relationship between soil mapping and the conceptual soil classification, the neglect or misuse of the systems approach and contemporary theories of classification, the lack of a universal soil classification system, and an orientation toward new technological advances. It is emphasized that hopes for a successful solution to the problems of soil mapping using the latest technologies, tools and methods are largely unjustified, since, first of all, a consistent theory of soil mapping is necessary.<br><br>The theoretical foundations and technology for multiscale soil-landscape mapping in a GIS environment are described. Multiscale soil-landscape maps are defined as a system of interconnected maps of all scale ranges, which have a single classification basis and coordinated thematic content. They contain integrated information about soils and landscape systems, which are landscapes, considered from the point of view of the systems approach, and display soils mainly as derived landscape system elements. Another distinctive feature of multiscale soil-landscape maps is that they reflect the relationship between soil properties, on the one hand, and properties of the basic landscape system elements (parent rocks, air, water, and organisms), on the other. The advantages of multiscale soil-landscape mapping in comparison with traditional and digital are shown. From a practical point of view, multiscale soil-landscape maps are considered as the basis for making scientifically sound decisions on sustainable nature management at all levels - from global to local.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The possibility of carbon storage in soils is of interest because compared to vegetation it contains more carbon. Estimation of soil carbon through remote sensing based techniques can be a cost effective approach, but is limited by available methods. This study aims to develop a model based on remotely sensed variables (elevation, forest type and above ground biomass) to estimate soil carbon stocks. Field observations on soil organic carbon, species composition, and above ground biomass were recorded in the subtropical forest of Chitwan, Nepal. These variables were also estimated using LiDAR data and a WorldView 2 image. Above ground biomass was estimated from the LiDAR image using a novel approach where the image was segmented to identify individual trees, and for these trees estimates of DBH and Height were made. Based on AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) a regression model with above ground biomass derived from LiDAR data, and forest type derived from WorldView 2 imagery was selected to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. The selected model had a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.69. This shows the scope of estimating SOC with remote sensing derived variables in sub-tropical forests.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Initial soil surveys are incomplete for large tracts of public land in the western USA. Digital soil mapping offers a quantitative approach as an alternative to traditional soil mapping. I sought to predict soil classes across an arid to semiarid watershed of western Utah by applying random forests (RF) and using environmental covariates derived from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and digital elevation models (DEM). Random forests are similar to classification and regression trees (CART). However, RF is doubly random. Many (e.g., 500) weak trees are grown (trained) independently because each tree is trained with a new randomly selected bootstrap sample, and a random subset of variables is used to split each node. To train and validate the RF trees, 561 soil descriptions were made in the field. An additional 111 points were added by case-based reasoning using aerial photo interpretation. As RF makes classification decisions from the mode of many independently grown trees, model uncertainty can be derived. The overall out of the bag (OOB) error was lower without weighting of classes; weighting increased the overall OOB error and the resulting output did not reflect soil-landscape relationships observed in the field. The final RF model had an OOB error of 55.2% and predicted soils on landforms consistent with soil-landscape relationships. The OOB error for individual classes typically decreased with increasing class size. In addition to the final classification, I determined the second and third most likely classification, model confidence, and the hypothetical extent of individual classes. Pixels that had high possibility of belonging to multiple soil classes were aggregated using a minimum confidence value based on limiting soil features, which is an effective and objective method of determining membership in soil map unit associations and complexes mapped at the 1:24,000 scale. Variables derived from both DEM and Landsat 7 ETM+ sources were important for predicting soil classes based on Gini and standard measures of variable importance and OOB errors from groves grown with exclusively DEM- or Landsat-derived data. Random forests was a powerful predictor of soil classes and produced outputs that facilitated further understanding of soil-landscape relationships.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: To deal with the global and regional issues including food security, climate change, land degradation, biodiversity loss, water resource management, and ecosystem health, detailed accurate spatial soil information is urgently needed. This drives the worldwide development of digital soil mapping. In recent years, significant progresses have been made in different aspects of digital soil mapping. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a review for the major progresses of digital soil mapping in the last decade. First, we briefly described the rise of digital soil mapping and outlined important milestones and their influence, and main paradigms in digital soil mapping. Then, we reviewed the progresses in legacy soil data, environmental covariates, soil sampling, predictive models and the applications of digital soil mapping products. Finally, we summarized the main trends and future prospect as revealed by studies up to now. We concluded that although the digital soil mapping is now moving towards mature to meet various demands of soil information, challenges including new theories, methodologies and applications of digital soil mapping, especially for highly heterogeneous and human-affected environments, still exist and need to be addressed in the future.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Reconnaissance soil maps at 1:250,000 scale are the most detailed source of soil information for large parts of France. For many environmental applications, however, the level of detail and accuracy of these maps is insufficient. Funds are lacking to refine and update these maps by traditional soil survey. In this study we investigated the merit of digital soil mapping to refine and improve the 1:250,000 reconnaissance soil map of a 1580 km2 area in Haute-Normandie, France. The soil map was produced in 1988 and distinguishes nine soil class units. The approach taken was to predict soil class from a large number of environmental covariates using regression techniques. The covariates used include DEM derivatives, geology and land cover maps. Because very few soil point observations were available within the area, we calibrated the regression model by sampling the soil map on a grid. We calibrated three models: classification tree (CT), multinomial logistic regression (MLR) and random forests (RF), and used these models to predict the nine soil classes across the study area. The new and original maps were validated with field data from 123 locations selected with a stratified simple random sampling design. For MLR, the estimate of the overall purity was 65.9%, while that of the reconnaissance map was 55.5%. The difference between the purity estimates of these maps was statistically significant (p = 0.014). The significant improvement over the existing soil map is remarkable because the regression model was calibrated with the existing soil map and uses no additional soil observations.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Knowledge of soil properties with complete area coverage is needed for policy-making, land resource management, and monitoring environmental impacts. Remote sensing offers possibilities to support Digital Soil Mapping, especially in data-poor regions. The aim of this work was to test the potential of time-series of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) vegetation and drought indices to provide relevant information to model topsoil properties in a Boreal-Atlantic region (Scotland) focussing on differentiation between soils with high and soils with low organic matter contents. For each of the three considered years, 345 MODIS data sets were included in the exploratory analysis; 15 data products for 23 dates (bi-weekly) per year. Terrain parameters derived from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission were also included. A methodology was implemented to exploit fully the high number of covariates, to identify the band, index or product that best correlates with the soil property of interest. In particular the proposed approach i. relies on freely globally available data-sets; ii. uses statistical criteria to select the combination of covariates providing the highest predictive capability, among the data considered and available; iii. deals with both continuous (using Generalized Additive Models, GAMs) and multinomial categorical (using Random Trees) types of variables; iv. takes into account fully the spatial autocorrelation of the data; v. provides estimates of the spatial uncertainty for each pixel; and vi. is computationally efficient when compared with methods such as forward stepwise. The models fitted show a fairly good agreement with existing data sets, presenting a consistent spatial pattern. The use of MODIS data as covariates increased the predictive capabilities of GAMs using only terrain parameters. The misclassification error for organic matter classes was between 25 and 35%. The assessment provided of the spatial uncertainty of the modelled values can be used in further modelling and in the assessment of consequences of climate-change and trade-off in land use changes. This approach can contribute to improving our understanding and modelling of soil processes and function over large, and relatively sparsely sampled, areas of the world.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Soil organic matter content (SOMC) is an important factor that reflects soil fertility, land production capacity, and the degree of soil degradation. The objectives of this study were to (i) test various regression models for estimating SOMC based on published spectral parameters in the Sanjiang Plain, (ii) develop optimal band difference, ratio, and normalized difference algorithms for assessing SOMC using spectral data, and (iii) compare the performance of the proposed models using grey relational analysis-artificial neural networks (GRA-ANN) and the band difference algorithm. The SOMC data and concurrent spectral parameters were acquired in the Sanjiang Plain of Northest China in 2006. For the GRA-ANN model, GRA was used to select the sensitive spectral parameters and ANN was established to estimate SOMC. The results showed that reflectance (R) gradually decreased with increasing SOMC and the regression equations based on the spectral parameter 1/R588, Diff (1/R835), R610, R654, R550, and R520 could be used to estimate SOMC, respectively. The SOMC model based on the optimal difference index (ODI; R2 = 0.63 and RMSE = 1.43%) outperformed those based on the optimal ratio vegetation index (ORVI; R2 = 0.48 and RMSE = 1.82%) and normalized difference vegetation index (ONDVI, R2 = 0.57 and RMSE = 1.56%). The GRA-ANN model presented better SOMC estimation results (R2 = 0.90 and RMSE = 0.88%). Thus, the GRA-ANN model has great potential for SOMC estimations; however, the ODI also has merit, especially when taking into consideration the simplicity of its application. Combining different algorithms may improve SOMC estimations on a regional scale.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Satellite remote sensing of land affected by salinity, is a useful tool for decision support system through digital image processing for materials delineation (crystallography, detection of rocks, mineralogy, etc.). Today, with the advent of technology integration, merger, with optical data radar (InSAR and Signal Processing) actively contributed to the modelling of radar backscattering coefficient for the quantitative and qualitative salinity (modelled coefficients for models in relation to soil moisture, surface roughness). Thus, our approach has been to exploit the multi-spectral optical data from the LANDSAT ETM + (Enhanced Thematic Mapper) to map surface states, including indices of salinity and sodicity as: (BI: Brightness Index), NDSI: Normalized Difference Salinity Index, SI: Salinity Index, ASI: Aster Salinity Index (Agriculture), Index of Salinity (using GIS Geographic Information System and remote sensing), and finally the SSSI “Soil Salinity and Sodicity Index”. These indicators of salinity were tested for the Oran region in accordance with the spectral sensor ALI (Advanced Land Imager) satellite EO-1 (NASA from 2002 to 2006). Remote sensing helps identify salts are highly reflective and improved mapping of saline soil surface. Reports of More frequently used is the combined near infrared and visible (4 / 1 ETM), or bands in the infrared (7 / 4 or 7 / 5 ETM). Consequently, the spectral curves of the satellite ALI EO-1 show a match for saline soils and two test plots were chosen (Aquifer of Es-Sénia) to study corresponding with the measured data in-situ (electrical conductivity and pH) for the classification of saline soils [2]. The confusions that arise between the effects of salt stress and water stress are removed followed by seasonal applying the Geo-statistical analysis with the Geo-modelling approach in GIS techniques investigation and monitoring the variation of the electrical conductivity in the alluvial aquifer of Es-Sénia for the salt affected soil and segmentation accuracy model.</td>

Soil reflectance spectroscopy has been applied in various domains apart from laboratory conditions, e.g., sensors mounted on satellites, aircrafts and Unmanned Aerial Systems. The aim of this review is to illustrate the research made for soil organic carbon estimation, with the use of RS techniques, reporting the methodology and results of each study. It also aims to provide a comprehensive introduction in soil spectroscopy for those who are less conversant with the subject. In total, 28 journal articles were selected and further analysed. It was observed that prediction accuracy reduces from Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) to satellite platforms, though advances in machine learning techniques could further assist in the generation of better calibration models. There are some challenges concerning atmospheric, radiometric and geometric corrections, vegetation cover, soil moisture and roughness that still need to be addressed. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach are highlighted and future considerations are also discussed at the end.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Notwithstanding the importance of soil surveys, advances in digital soil mapping have mainly focused on mapping soil attributes or properties rather than developing digital maps of soil units or soil classes. The purpose of this research was to develop digital soil unit maps based on primary soil data collection in areas without previously collected soil information. The covariate variability, the random effect across the data subset and the map outputs were the focuses of this study. We used five datasets with four models (Random Forest – RF, Gradient Boosted Machine – GBM, C5.0, and multinomial log-linear model – MLR). The covariates were grouped into five datasets, where four were grouped by Region Of Interest per Class (ROIC) and one was not grouped by ROIC. To evaluate the random effect to split the dataset, we ran each model 50 times and observed the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa index, and uncertainty, majority and variety maps. The OA of Dataset01 to 04 was lower than to Dataset05 accuracy. However, map outputs of RF and GBM for Dataset01 and Dataset05 had the same majority prediction. It seems that RF and GBM produce consistent results in map outputs according to this methodology and pedologist expertise. To evaluate the uncertainty and the consistency of soil unit prediction, we used the majority maps process. Random Forest, similar to GBM, presented the best results. The increase in the number of covariates was not a guarantee of improvement in the OA or in the quality of the map output. Geographic position and distance raster did not improve the map output according to expert evaluation. Because the variance between the ROICs, when the training and validation datasets were split based on it, the subsets are quite different in relation to the covariates, and this is the reason for the worse results of this model, comparing with the Dataset05. On the other hand, when considering one complete dataset not based on ROICs, the variance of training and validation subsets is lower and produced more accurate parameters of quality.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Much attention has been paid to sampling design optimization over the past decades. Many methods have been developed and applied, but only a few of these deal with simultaneous optimization of the sampling design for multiple soil variables. In this paper we present a method implemented as R-code that minimizes the average kriging variance (AKV) for multiple soil variables simultaneously. The method is illustrated with real soil data from an experimental field in central Czech Republic. The goal of the method is to minimize the sample size while keeping the AKV values of all tested soil variables below given thresholds. We defined and tested two different objective functions, critical AKV optimization and weighted sum of AKV optimization, both based on the AKV minimization with annealing algorithm. The crucial moment for such an optimization is defining the mutual spatial relationship between all soil variables with the Linear Model of Coregionalization and proper modelling of all (cross)variograms which are used in the optimization process. In addition, a separate optimization was made for each of the tested soil characteristics to evaluate a possible gain of the simultaneous approach.<br><br>The results showed that the final design for multivariate sampling is “fully-optimal” for one soil variable — optimal number of observations and optimal structure of sampling pattern, and “sub-optimal” for the others, while no clear difference between the two optimization criteria was found. We can recommend using the method in situations where periodical soil surveys are planned and where multivariate soil characteristics are determined from the same soil samples at once.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Machine learning techniques are widely employed to generate digital soil maps. The map accuracy is partly determined by the number and spatial locations of the measurements used to calibrate the machine learning model. However, determining the optimal sampling design for mapping with machine learning techniques has not yet been considered in detail in digital soil mapping studies. In this paper, we investigate sampling design optimization for soil mapping with random forest. A design is optimized using spatial simulated annealing by minimizing the mean squared prediction error (MSE). We applied this approach to mapping soil organic carbon for a part of Europe using subsamples of the LUCAS dataset. The optimized subsamples are used as input for the random forest machine learning model, using a large set of readily available environmental data as covariates. We also predicted the same soil property using subsamples selected by simple random sampling, conditioned Latin Hypercube sampling (cLHS), spatial coverage sampling and feature space coverage sampling. Distributions of the estimated population MSEs are obtained through repeated random splitting of the LUCAS dataset, serving as the population of interest, into subsets used for validation, testing and selection of calibration samples, and repeated selection of calibration samples with the various sampling designs. The differences between the medians of the MSE distributions were tested for significance using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. The process was repeated for different sample sizes. We also analyzed the spread of the optimized designs in both geographic and feature space to reveal their characteristics. Results show that optimization of the sampling design by minimizing the MSE is worthwhile for small sample sizes. However, an important disadvantage of sampling design optimization using MSE is that it requires known values of the soil property at all locations and as a consequence is only feasible for subsampling an existing dataset. For larger sample sizes, the effect of using an MSE optimized design diminishes. In this case, we recommend to use a sample spread uniformly in the feature (i.e. covariate) space of the most important random forest covariates. The results also show that for our case study, cLHS sampling performs worse than the other sampling designs for mapping with random forest. We stress that comparison of sampling designs for calibration by splitting the data just once is very sensitive to the data split that one happens to use if the validation set is small.</td>

The basic sampling designs historically implemented for map accuracy assessment have served well for the error matrix based analyses traditionally used. But contemporary applications of land cover maps place greater demands on accuracy assessment, and sampling designs must be constructed to target objectives such as accuracy of land cover composition and landscape pattern. Sampling designs differ in their suitability to achieve different objectives, and trade-offs among desirable sampling design criteria must be recognized and accommodated when selecting a design. An overview is presented of the sampling designs used in accuracy assessment, and the status of these designs is appraised for meeting current needs.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Sampling design (SD) plays a crucial role in providing reliable input for digital soil mapping (DSM) and increasing its efficiency. Sampling design, with a predetermined sample size and consideration of budget and spatial variability, is a selection procedure for identifying a set of sample locations spread over a geographical space or with a good feature space coverage. A good feature space coverage ensures accurate estimation of regression parameters, while spatial coverage contributes to effective spatial interpolation. First, we review several statistical and geometric SDs that mainly optimize the sampling pattern in a geographical space and illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of these SDs by considering spatial coverage, simplicity, accuracy, and efficiency. Furthermore, Latin hypercube sampling, which obtains a full representation of multivariate distribution in geographical space, is described in detail for its development, improvement, and application. In addition, we discuss the fuzzy k-means sampling, response surface sampling, and Kennard-Stone sampling, which optimize sampling patterns in a feature space. We then discuss some practical applications that are mainly addressed by the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling with the flexibility and feasibility of adding multiple optimization criteria. We also discuss different methods of validation, an important stage of DSM, and conclude that an independent dataset selected from the probability sampling is superior for its free model assumptions. For future work, we recommend: 1) exploring SDs with both good spatial coverage and feature space coverage; 2) uncovering the real impacts of an SD on the integral DSM procedure; and 3) testing the feasibility and contribution of SDs in three-dimensional (3D) DSM with variability for multiple layers.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In the past decade, substantial progress has been made in model-based optimization of sampling designs for mapping. This paper is an update of the overview of sampling designs for mapping presented by de Gruijter et al. (2006). For model-based estimation of values at unobserved points (mapping), probability sampling is not required, which opens up the possibility of optimized non-probability sampling. Non-probability sampling designs for mapping are regular grid sampling, spatial coverage sampling, k-means sampling, conditioned Latin hypercube sampling, response surface sampling, Kennard-Stone sampling and model-based sampling. In model-based sampling a preliminary model of the spatial variation of the soil variable of interest is used for optimizing the sample size and or the spatial coordinates of the sampling locations. Kriging requires knowledge of the variogram. Sampling designs for variogram estimation are nested sampling, independent random sampling of pairs of points, and model-based designs in which either the uncertainty about the variogram parameters, or the uncertainty about the kriging variance is minimized. Various minimization criteria have been proposed for designing a single sample that is suitable both for estimating the variogram and for mapping. For map validation, additional probability sampling is recommended, so that unbiased estimates of map quality indices and their standard errors can be obtained. For all sampling designs, R scripts are available in the supplement. Further research is recommended on sampling designs for mapping with machine learning techniques, designs that are robust against deviations of modeling assumptions, designs tailored at mapping multiple soil variables of interest and soil classes or fuzzy memberships, and probability sampling designs that are efficient both for design-based estimation of populations means and for model-based mapping.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The increase in digital soil mapping around the world means that appropriate and efficient sampling strategies are needed for validation. Data used for calibrating a digital soil mapping model typically are non-random samples. In such a case we recommend collection of additional independent data and validation of the soil map by a design-based sampling strategy involving probability sampling and design-based estimation of quality measures. An important advantage over validation by data-splitting or cross-validation is that model-free estimates of the quality measures and their standard errors can be obtained, and thus no assumptions on the spatial auto-correlation of prediction errors need to be made. The quality of quantitative soil maps can be quantified by the spatial cumulative distribution function (SCDF) of the prediction errors, whereas for categorical soil maps the overall purity and the map unit purities (user's accuracies) and soil class representation (producer's accuracies) are suitable quality measures. The suitability of five basic types of random sampling design for soil map validation was evaluated: simple, stratified simple, systematic, cluster and two-stage random sampling. Stratified simple random sampling is generally a good choice: it is simple to implement, estimation of the quality measures and their precision is straightforward, it gives relatively precise estimates, and no assumptions are needed in quantifying the standard error of the estimated quality measures. Validation by probability sampling is illustrated with two case studies. A categorical soil map on point support depicting soil classes in the province of Drenthe of the Netherlands (268 000 ha) was validated by stratified simple random sampling. Sub-areas with different expected purities were used as strata. The estimated overall purity was 58% with a standard error of 4%. This was 9% smaller than the theoretical purity computed with the model. Map unit purities and class representations were estimated by the ratio estimator. A quantitative soil map, depicting the average soil organic carbon (SOC) contents of pixels in an area of 81 600 ha in Senegal, was validated by random transect sampling. SOC predictions were seriously biased, and the random error was considerable. Both case studies underpin the importance of independent validation of soil maps by probability sampling, to avoid unfounded trust in visually attractive maps produced by advanced pedometric techniques.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Designing a sampling strategy for soil property mapping from remote sensing imagery entails making decisions about sampling pattern and number of samples. A consistent number of ancillary data strongly related to the target variable allows applying a sampling strategy that optimally covers the feature space. This study aims at evaluating the capability of multispectral (Sentinel-2) and hyperspectral (EnMAP) satellite data to select the sampling locations in order to collect a calibration dataset for multivariate statistical modelling of the Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) content in the topsoil of croplands. We tested different sampling strategies based on the feature space, where the ancillary data are the spectral bands of the Sentinel-2 and of simulated EnMAP satellite data acquired in Demmin (north-east Germany). Some selection algorithms require setting the number of samples in advance (random, Kennard-Stones and conditioned Latin Hypercube algorithms) where others automatically provide the ideal number of samples (Puchwein, SELECT and Puchwein+SELECT algorithm). The SOC content and the spectra extracted at the sampling locations were used to build random forest (RF) models. We evaluated the accuracy of the RF estimation models on an independent dataset. The lowest Sentinel-2 normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) for the validation set was obtained using Puchwein (nRMSE: 8.7%), and Kennard-Stones (9.2%) algorithms. The most efficient sampling strategies, expressed as the ratio between accuracy and number of samples per hectare, were obtained using Puchwein with EnMAP and Puchwein+SELECT algorithm with Sentinel-2 data. Hence, Sentinel-2 and EnMAP data can be exploited to build a reliable calibration dataset for SOC mapping. For EnMAP, the different selection algorithms provided very similar results. On the other hand, using Puchwein and Kennard-Stones algorithms, Sentinel-2 provided a more accurate estimation than the EnMAP. The calibration datasets provided by EnMAP data provided lower SOC<br>variability and lower prediction accuracy compared to Sentinel-2. This was probably due to EnMAP coarser spatial resolution (30 m) less adequate for linkage to the sampling performed at 10 m scale.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Soil clay content is a key parameter that influences many other soil properties and processes. The potential of adding new and contemporary satellite data for soil property mapping in France is assessed in this study. The soil property maps used for this analysis were produced within the framework of GlobalSoilMap, which was created to deliver global fine grids of soil properties and associated uncertainties using existing soil information and ancillary data to predict these properties based on digital soil mapping techniques. In this study, we evaluate the added value of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Project for On-Board Autonomy-Vegetation (PROBA-V), and Sentinel-2 (S2) data for predicting the soil clay content at 90 m resolution for mainland France. The rationale behind adding these data is that satellite images and derived products may enable the biogeochemical characteristics of the earth’s surface to be captured more effectively, which in turn enables more precise predictions of the soil clay content. For this methodology, we i) create composite bare soil mosaics and derive the spectral indices from S2 data acquired during sowing periods from 2016 to 2017, ii) extract the first three principal components of harmonized MODIS and PROBA-V normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series acquired in 2003 and 2016 to represent vegetation changes, and iii) test whether the complementary datasets are able to improve the soil clay information compared to a benchmark value. The soil clay content is obtained by using quantile regression forest (QRF) for each GlobalSoilMap depth interval of 0–5 cm, 5–15 cm, 15–30 cm, 30–60 cm, 60–100 cm, and 100–200 cm along with a 10-fold cross-validation having 10 replicates. The results show that the complementary satellite data improve the clay content estimation on bare soil for the topsoil layers (e.g., 0–30 cm) by increasing the R² and decreasing the bias at averages of 0.05 and 1 g kg−1, respectively. Moreover, the first principal component of the harmonized NDVI data is shown to be the second most important variable for estimating the clay content, as indicated by the QRF models. However, the use of only the satellite data and products as input for the QRF does not yield a satisfactory estimate of the clay content. Finally, this work provides a reference for embedding new remote sensing data in existing national soil inventories and national soil information systems. Further research should incorporate new techniques for considering the spatial–temporal variability of the earth’s surface parameters such as soil moisture and roughness.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The digital representation of the Earth’s surface by terrain attributes is largely dependent on the scale at which they are computed. Typically the effects of scale on terrain attributes have only been investigated as a function of digital elevation model (DEM) grid size, rather than the neighborhood size over which they are computed. With high-resolution DEM now becoming more readily available, a multi-scale terrain analysis approach may be a more viable option to filter out the large amount short-range variation present within them, as opposed to coarsening the resolution of a DEM, and thereby more accurately represent soil-landscape processes. To evaluate this hypothesis, two examples are provided. The first study was designed to evaluate the systematic effects of varying both grid and neighborhood size on terrain attributes computed from LiDAR. In a second study, the objective was to examine how the correlations between soil and terrain attributes vary with neighborhood size, so as to provide an empirical measure of what neighborhood size may be most appropriate. Results suggest that the overall representation of the land surface by terrain attributes is specific to the land surface, but also that the terrain attributes vary independently in response to spatial extent over which they are computed. Results also indicate that finer grid sizes are more sensitive to the scale of terrain attribute calculation than larger grid sizes. For the soil properties examined in this study, slope curvatures produced the highest coefficients of correlation when calculated at neighborhood sizes between 117 and 189 m.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Digital soil mapping (DSM) increasingly makes use of machine learning algorithms to identify relationships between soil properties and multiple covariates that can be detected across landscapes. Selecting the appropriate algorithm for model building is critical for optimizing results in the context of the available data. Over the past decade, many studies have tested different machine learning (ML) approaches on a variety of soil data sets. Here, we review the application of some of the most popular ML algorithms for digital soil mapping. Specifically, we compare the strengths and weaknesses of multiple linear regression (MLR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), Cubist, random forest (RF), and artificial neural networks (ANN) for DSM. These algorithms were compared on the basis of five factors: (1) quantity of hyperparameters, (2) sample size, (3) covariate selection, (4) learning time, and (5) interpretability of the resulting model. If training time is a limitation, then algorithms that have fewer model parameters and hyperparameters should be considered, e.g., MLR, KNN, SVR, and Cubist. If the data set is large (thousands of samples) and computation time is not an issue, ANN would likely produce the best results. If the data set is small (<100), then Cubist, KNN, RF, and SVR are likely to perform better than ANN and MLR. The uncertainty in predictions produced by Cubist, KNN, RF, and SVR may not decrease with large datasets. When interpretability of the resulting model is important to the user, Cubist, MLR, and RF are more appropriate algorithms as they do not function as “black boxes.” There is no one correct approach to produce models for predicting the spatial distribution of soil properties. Nonetheless, some algorithms are more appropriate than others considering the nature of the data and purpose of mapping activity.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: There is a growing demand for digital soil maps for environmental planning, modeling and management. If mapped soil classes are taken from a hierarchical taxonomic system, a question arises: which taxonomic level is most appropriate to be depicted on the map with a given sample size, available environmental covariates and the strength of predictive relations between covariates and the soil classes? Pedodiversity, the study and measurement of soil diversity, can be considered as a framework to analyze spatial patterns depicted on soil maps. This paper discusses the selection of the taxonomic level for soil mapping in an arid region in southeast Iran on the basis of (1) the purity of a digital soil class map derived from an artificial neural network (ANN) prediction method using environmental covariates and (2) pedodiversity indices of these soil maps. The prediction of soil classes and the calculation of diversity indices were carried out for taxonomic categories of order, suborder, great group, and subgroup. Using the feed forward back-propagation algorithm, three-layer ANNs with input, hidden and output layers were trained for soil class prediction at each category level. In most predictions, the combined use of terrain attributes and geomorphic surfaces provided the best results. When the taxonomic level changed from order to subgroup, the purity decreased, whereas the values of the diversity indices increased. The highest purity and lowest diversity are observed at the order level, indicating a good quality map in terms of its purity, but reflecting only little soil diversity, thus with a low usage potential. On the other hand, soil maps at the level of subgroup illustrate high diversity and low purity, so that the predicted map units are highly uncertain. This map is also inappropriate for users. We introduced an index combining the diversity and purity which indicated that the best taxonomic level for soil mapping in the study area is the great group, with both high diversity and purity.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: A large number of predictor variables can be used in digital soil mapping; however, the presence of irrelevant covariables may compromise the prediction of soil types. Thus, algorithms can be applied to select the most relevant predictors. This study aimed to compare three covariable selection systems (two filter algorithms and one wrapper algorithm) and assess their impacts on the predictive model. The study area was the Lajeado River Watershed in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. We used forty predictor covariables, derived from a digital elevation model with 30 m resolution, in which the three selection models were applied and separated into subsets. These subsets were used to assess performance by applying four prediction algorithms. The wrapper method obtained the best performance values for the predictive model in all the algorithms evaluated. The three selection methods applied reduced the number of covariables in the predictive models by 70 % and enabled prediction of the 14 soil mapping units.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Selection of training samples plays an important role in updating conventional soil maps with data mining models. In this paper, we developed a method to determine spatial locations of training samples based on spatial neighborhood analysis of environmental covariates for each soil polygon. Training samples were selected based on a single environmental variable or integrated variables generated using multiple variables. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to test the effect of different spatial neighborhood sizes and selected sample numbers on soil mapping accuracy. Random selection of training samples from soil polygons and soil types respectively were applied to compare with the proposed method in a study area in Raffelson watershed in La Crosse, Wisconsin of USA. Random forest was adopted as the soil prediction model. Results showed that training samples selected using single variables such as Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), slope, plan curvature, profile curvature or slope length factor with the proposed method improved the overall mapping accuracies compared with the conventional soil map, of which using TWI achieved the highest improvement of 27%. The proposed method using TWI, slope or slope length factor performed better than random selection strategies. Random selection from soil polygons generated higher overall mapping accuracies than from soil types. It was concluded that using composite environmental variables which could represent the soil forming environment of a study area well is recommended when applying the proposed method. The proposed method is not sensitive to the selected sample number, but an appropriate neighborhood size is needed for using the proposed method. In our study area with small spatial coverage, neighborhood size 5 × 5 or 3 × 3 is recommended.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Disaggregation of conventional soil surveys has been identified as a potential source for much of the next generation of model-ready digital soil spatial data. This process aims to apportion vector soil surveys into raster (gridded) representations of the component soils that are often aggregated together in map unit designs. Most soil surveys are published with some description of the soil–landscape relationships that distinguish component soils within map units. We used these descriptions found in the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database of Webster and Pocahontas Counties in West Virginia, USA, to build a set of representative training areas for all soil components by using 1-arc second digital elevation data and derived geomorphic indices. These training areas were then used in classification tree ensembles with a more extensive environmental database to transform the original SSURGO map into a gridded soil series map. We created underlying prediction frequency surfaces from the models that can be used for creating continuous representations of soil class and property distributions.<br><br>Disaggregation models matched training sets in 71%–74% of pixels and matched components in original SSURGO map units in 56%–65% of the study area. We evaluated both the original SSURGO data and our models using 87 independent pedons not used in model building. Validation pedons matched components in SSURGO map units at 39% of sites, but in map units that only included one named component (as opposed to multiple soils that could be matched to validation pedons) only 27% of the sites matched. Disaggregation predictions matched validation pedon classes 22–24% of the time using nearest neighbor spatial matches, and these rates increased to 39–44% for correct predictions within a 60-meter radius of the pedon. To characterize uncertainty, we compared relative ensemble prediction frequency (probability) of final hardened model classes at validation sites. Sites with correct predictions had generally higher prediction frequencies; which lead us to use them to create an uncertainty model. Uncertainty was calculated by determining the rate of correct predictions at validation sites within different intervals of prediction frequencies using nearest neighbor validation results. We were able to discern four uncertainty classes with values of 7%, 18%, 20% and 43%, which we called “ground truth probabilities”. We present the methods to create these models as a specific example of how disaggregation techniques may be used to aid in updating national soil survey inventories.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Pilot studies have demonstrated the potential of remote sensing for soil organic carbon (SOC) mapping in exposed croplands. However, the use of remote sensing for SOC prediction is often hindered by disturbing factors at the soil surface, such as photosynthetic active and non-photosynthetic active vegetation, variation in soil moisture or surface roughness. With the increasing amount of freely available satellite data, recent studies have focused on stabilizing the soil reflectance by building image composites. These composites tend to minimize the disturbing effects by applying sets of criteria. Here, we aim to develop a robust method that allows selecting Sentinel-2 (S-2) pixels with minimal influence of the following disturbing factors: crop residues, surface roughness and soil moisture. We selected all S-2 cloud-free images covering the Belgian Loam Belt from January 2019 to December 2020 (in total 36 images). We then built nine exposed soil composites based on four sets of criteria: (1) lowest Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR2), (2) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) < 0.25, (3–5) NDVI < 0.25 and NBR2 < threshold, (6) the ‘greening-up’ period of a crop and (7–9) the ‘greening-up’ period of a crop and NBR2 < threshold. The ‘greening-up’ period was selected based on the NDVI timeline, where ‘greening-up’ is considered as the last date of acquisition where the soil is exposed (NDVI < 0.25) before the crop develops (NDVI > 0.25). We then built a partial least square regression (PLSR) model with 10-fold cross-validation to estimate the SOC content based on 137 georeferenced calibration samples on the nine composites. We obtained non-satisfactory results (R2 < 0.30, RMSE > 2.50 g C kg–1, and RPD < 1.4, n > 68) for all composites except for the composite in the ‘greening-up’ stage with a NBR2 < 0.07 (R2 = 0.54 ± 0.12, RPD = 1.68 ± 0.45 and RMSE = 2.09 ± 0.39 g C kg–1, n = 49). Hence, the ‘greening-up’ method combined with a strict NBR2 threshold allows selecting the purest exposed soil pixels suitable for SOC prediction. The limit of this method might be its coverage of the total cropland area, which in a two-year period reached 62%, compared to 95% coverage if only the NDVI threshold is applied.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: To be fully operational for facilitating decisions made at any spatial level, models and indicators of soil ecosystem functions require the use of precise spatially referenced soil information as inputs. This study aimed at exploring the capacity for Sentinel-2A (S2A) multispectral satellite images to predict several topsoil properties in two contrasted pedoclimatic environments: a temperate region marked by intensive annual crop cultivation patterns and soils derived from loess or colluvium and/or marine limestone or chalk (Versailles Plain, 221 km2); and a Mediterranean region marked by vineyard cultivation and soils derived from lacustrine limestone, calcareous sandstones, colluvium, or alluvial deposits (Peyne catchment, 48 km2). Prediction models of soil properties based on partial least squares regressions (PLSR) were built from S2A spectra of 72 and 143 sampling locations across the Versailles Plain and Peyne catchment, respectively. Eight soil surface properties were investigated in both regions: pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), texture fractions (Clay, Silt, Sand), Iron, Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3) and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) content. Predictive abilities were studied according to the root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) tests, cross-validated coefficient of determination (R2cv) and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). Intermediate prediction performance outcomes (R2cv and RPD greater than or equal to 0.5 and 1.4, respectively) were obtained for 4 topsoil properties found across the Versailles Plain (SOC, pH, CaCO3 and CEC), and near-intermediate performance outcomes (0.5 > R2cv > 0.39, 1.4 > RPD > 1.3) were yielded for 3 topsoil properties (Clay, Iron, and CEC) found across the Peyne catchment and for 1 property (Clay) found across the Versailles Plain. The study results show what can be expected from Sentinel-2 images in terms of predictive capacities at the regional scale. The spatial structure of the estimated soil properties for bare soils pixels is highlighted, promising further improvements made to spatial prediction models for these properties based on the use of Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) techniques.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Changes in land cover will cause the changes in the climate and environmental characteristics, which has an important influence on the social economy and ecosystem. The main form of land cover is different types of soil. Compared with traditional methods, visible and near-infrared spectroscopy technology can classify different types of soil rapidly, effectively, and nondestructively. Based on the visible near-infrared spectroscopy technology, this paper takes the soil of six different land cover types in Qingdao, China orchards, woodlands, tea plantations, farmlands, bare lands, and grasslands as examples and establishes a convolutional neural network classification model. The classification results of different number of training samples are analyzed and compared with the support vector machine algorithm. Under the condition that Kennard–Stone algorithm divides the calibration set, the classification results of six different soil types and single six soil types by convolutional neural network are better than those by the support vector machine. Under the condition of randomly dividing the calibration set according to the proportion of 1/3 and 1/4, the classification results by convolutional neural network are also better. The aim of this study is to analyze the feasibility of land cover classification with small samples by convolutional neural network and, according to the deep learning algorithm, to explore new methods for rapid, nondestructive, and accurate classification of the land cover.</td>

In order to collect data, several laboratory tests are performed on 120 undisturbed soil samples, which are obtained from Antalya region. Additionally, for the evaluation of the generalization ability of clustering analysis, 20 fine grained soil samples collected from the other regions of Turkey are also classified using the same clustering algorithms. Fuzzy c-means algorithm exhibited better clustering performance over hard k-means classifier. As expected, clustering analysis produced worse outcomes for soils collected from different regions than those of obtained from a specific region. In addition to its precise classification ability, fuzzy c-means approach is also capable of handling the uncertainty existing in soil parameters. As a result, fuzzy c-means clustering can be successfully applied to classify regional fine grained soils on the basis of shear strength and plasticity index parameters.</td>

There are some application softwares of soil database to manage such a large amount of data, i.e.: Side &amp; Horizon (SHDE4), Soil Sample Analysis (SSA), and Land Unit in dbf file, while Site and Horizon is in DataEase formats. The database contains soil physics and chemical property data of each soil horizon from surface to effective soil depth, climate, land surface condi- tions, and other parameters required for soil classification. Currently, database management software for land resources is still based on DOS and is stand alone. The system is not efficient and effectively used as Agri- cultural Land Resource Information System. At present, as a key component of this system requires review and development of new database software is compatible with the development of information technology. This paper explains about development of interactive agricultural land resources information system for op- timizing land resources data utilization. Hopefully, the software can give contributions in national Agricul- tural Land Resources System Information development for supporting food security.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Many predictive soil mapping (PSM) methods encounter two problems. One is how to construct a similarity index that can indicate not only the similarity of an environmental covariate between sites but also the directional difference of the covariate itself between sites and predict the soil property values beyond the range of sample values. Another is how to determine which soil samples should be used when estimating the soil property value at an unknown site. We propose a new asymmetrical environmental contrast index between an unknown site and a sample site to address the first problem, based on which we developed an enhancive predictive coefficient (EPC)-based soil mapping (EPSM) method. EPC integrates the contrasts of associated environmental principal component covariates by the weights of the covariates influencing a certain soil property. A member recruiting process was programmed to determine the calculating samples for an unknown site after conducting an uncertainty threshold (ut) test for all the sample sites. We applied the EPSM method to five data groups with different numbers and distributions of sample sites for prediction. The results showed that the EPSM method performs better than the soil-land inference model (SoLIM) method regardless the value of ut and thus can be used to estimate the soil property values well at most unknown sites. The method is especially valid when the unknown sites are spatially far from the sample sites and when sample sites are limited in number or spatially distributed at a local area. Our study suggests that the EPSM method is an effective PSM method that can be widely used in soil mapping.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling have been important drivers in the advancement of our understanding of soil from the earliest days of the scientific study of soils. Soil maps were desirable for purposes of land valuation for taxation, agronomic planning, and even in military operations. Soil mapping required classification systems that would allow communication of mapped information, classification systems required understanding of the soil system, and gaining that understanding included the creation of soil models. Therefore, advancement in one of these highly interrelated areas tended to lead to corresponding advances in the others, and these relationships persist into the modern era. Although many advances in our understanding of the soil system have been made since the late 1800s, when soil science blossomed into a scientific discipline in its own right, there are still many unanswered questions and additional needs in soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling. New technologies including GPS, GIS, remote sensing, on-site geophysical instrumentation (EMI, GPR, PXRF, etc.), and the development of statistical and geostatistical techniques have greatly increased our ability to collect, analyze, and predict spatial information related to soils, but linking all of this new information to soil properties and processes can still be a challenge and enhanced pedologic models are needed. The expansion of the use of soil knowledge to address issues beyond agronomic production, such as land use planning, environmental concerns, food security, energy security, water security, and human health, to name a few, requires new ways to communicate what we know about the soils we map as well as bringing forth research questions that were not widely considered in earlier soils studies. At present this information is communicated using dozens of national soil classification systems as well as WRB, but a more universal soil classification system would facilitate international communication of soils information. There are still many significant needs in the area of soil mapping, classification, and pedologic modeling going into the future.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The most commonly used approach to estimate soil variables from remote-sensing data entails time-consuming and expensive data collection including chemical and physical laboratory analysis. Large spectral libraries could be exploited to decrease the effort of soil variable estimation and obtain more widely applicable models. We investigated the feasibility of a new approach, referred to as bottom-up, to provide soil organic carbon (SOC) maps of bare cropland fields over a large area without recourse to chemical analyses, employing both the pan-European topsoil database from the Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS) and Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) hyperspectral airborne data. This approach was tested in two areas having different soil characteristics: the loam belt in Belgium, and the Gutland–Oesling region in Luxembourg. Partial least square regression (PLSR) models were used in each study area to estimate SOC content, using both bottom-up and traditional approaches. The PLSR model’s accuracy was tested on an independent validation dataset. Both approaches provide SOC maps having a satisfactory level of accuracy (RMSE = 1.5–4.9 g·kg−1; ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) = 1.4–1.7) and the inter-comparison did not show differences in terms of RMSE and RPD either in the loam belt or in Luxembourg. Thus, the bottom-up approach based on APEX data provided high-resolution SOC maps over two large areas showing the within- and between-field SOC variability.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Visible–near infrared–shortwave infrared (VIS–NIR–SWIR) spectroscopy is being increasingly used for soil organic carbon (SOC) assessment. Common practice consists of scanning soil samples using a single spectrometer. Considerations have rarely been documented of the effects of using multiple instruments and scanning conditions on SOC model calibration that occur when merging soil spectral libraries (SSLs), particularly in soils with low SOC concentration and using both field spectroradiometers and laboratory fixed spectrometers. To address this gap, we scanned 143 low-SOC-content soil samples using three spectrometers (ASD FieldSpec 3, ASD FieldSpec 4, and FOSS XDS) and four setup features - FOSS, contact probe (CP), dark-box (DB), and open laboratory (LAB) - at three laboratories. The application of an internal soil standard (ISS) to align one laboratory spectrum with another for spectral correction and spectral merging of various SSLs was examined. SOC models were developed using i) data from each single spectrometer – single laboratory separately and ii) merged data from multiple spectrometers – different laboratories, applying the 1st derivatives of spectra and random forest (RF) regression. The results indicate that the spectral shape and position obtained from all spectrometers and setups did not show any noticeable differences, though spectra based on FOSS setup, particularly on low-SOC samples, demonstrated the highest absolute derivative values regardless of ISS application. The derivative ISS-corrected spectra showed less variation among different spectrometers compared to their uncorrected reflectance spectra. All single spectrometer models predicted SOC reasonably well. However, the spectra acquired by the FOSS setup predicted SOC more accurately (R2 = 0.77 and SD = 0.04) than the spectra acquired by the other setups. The models derived from merged uncorrected reflectance spectra yielded poor results (R2 = 0.48 and SD = 0.10); nevertheless, assessment of SOC using the 1st derivative ISS-corrected merged SSLs considerably improved the prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.70 and SD = 0.06). Hence, the derivative spectra coupled with the ISS correction improved the accuracy of SOC prediction models obtained from merged soil spectra collected in different environments using different instruments. We therefore recommend application of the ISS spectral alignment method linked to the 1st derivative approach to enhance the compilation of SSLs at the regional and global scales for SOC assessment.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Soil organic carbon (SOC) loss is one of the main causes of soil degradation in croplands.<br>Thus, spatial and temporal monitoring of SOC is extremely important, both from the environmental<br>and economic perspective. In this regard, the high temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution of the<br>Sentinel-2 data can be exploited for monitoring SOC contents in the topsoil of croplands. In this<br>study, we aim to test the effect of the threshold for a spectral index linked to soil moisture and crop<br>residues on the performance of SOC prediction models using the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI)<br>Sentinel-2 and the European Land Use/cover Area frame Statistical survey (LUCAS) topsoil database.<br>The LUCAS spectral data resampled according to MSI/Sentinel-2 bands, which were used to build<br>SOC prediction models combining pairs of the bands. The SOC models were applied to a Sentinel-2<br>image acquired in North-Eastern Germany after removing the pixels characterized by clouds and<br>green vegetation. Then, we tested different thresholds of the Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (NBR2) index<br>in order to mask moist soil pixels and those with dry vegetation and crop residues. The model<br>accuracy was tested on an independent validation database and the best ratio of performance to<br>deviation (RPD) was obtained using the average between bands B6 and B5 (Red-Edge Carbon Index:<br>RE-CI) (RPD: 4.4) and between B4 and B5 (Red-Red-Edge Carbon Index: RRE-CI) (RPD: 2.9) for a very<br>low NBR2 threshold (0.05). Employing a higher NBR2 tolerance (higher NBR2 values), the mapped<br>area increases to the detriment of the validation accuracy. The proposed approach allowed us to<br>accurately map SOC over a large area exploiting the LUCAS spectral library and, thus, avoid a new ad<br>hoc field campaign. Moreover, the threshold for selecting the bare soil pixels can be tuned, according<br>to the goal of the survey. The quality of the SOC map for each tolerance level can be judged based on<br>the figures of merit of the model.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Visible and near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy is a rapid, accurate, cost-effective, and nondestructive alternative method for soil analysis. The aim of this study was to examine the potential of Vis-NIR spectroscopy to predict soil organic carbon (SOC) content. In total, 194 soil samples were collected from 46 soil profiles in the Kur-Aras plain dominated by Calcisols, Gleysols, and Anthrosols, Azerbaijan. SOC content was predicted by partial least squares regression (PLSR) using spectral reflectance data. In the modeling phase, spectral data were involved in preprocessing and transformation techniques. The dataset was randomly separated into two subsets: a calibration subset and a validation subset that was independent of the calibration subset. Modeling results were evaluated based on coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error of prediction (RMSE), and residual prediction deviation (RPD). Most optimal calibration model was considered when the prediction of the leave-one-out cross-validation showed best performance. This study found that different preprocessing procedures effect model performance. SOC content significantly effected spectral reflectance from soil, where a decrease in reflectance with an increase in SOC was determined through the entire wavelength. We obtained an accurate prediction model for SOC with the R2, RMSE, and RPD values of cross validation 0.85, 3.77 g/kg, and 2.54, respectively. This model is valid over the range 3.80–6.71 g/kg of SOC content. Further attempts need to be given to different calibration strategies to more accurately predict SOC content.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Because relief maps show a strict relationship with soils at different spatial levels, distributions of soil units can be inferred from digital topography analyses. Geoprocessing techniques can be used to create parametric relief representations from digital terrain models (DTMs), and these models can be used to calculate primary and secondary topographical attributes, such as the elevation, profile and plan curvature, slope, stream power index, topographic wetness index, and sediment transport index. The classic method of pedological cartography is onerous and time-consuming; as an alternative, pedometric techniques favor the recognition of preliminary mapping units. In this study, a multilayered perceptron artificial neural network (ANN) with an error backpropagation algorithm was used, where topographical and geological attributes were used as input parameters. The classified map was validated by comparison with two preexisting conventional ground maps of the study area. The kappa (K) index, global exactness (GE), and exactness from the point of view of the producer and user were considered in the comparison. The quality of the soil units classified by the ANN was satisfactory, based on the K and GE values from the comparison.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Soil chemical and physical analyses are the major sources of data for agriculture. However, traditional soil analyses are time-consuming, not cost-efficient, and not environmentally friendly. An alternative to traditional soil analyses is soil spectroscopy. This technique is a low-cost and quick analytical method, which can be implemented in a laboratory and/or in-situ. Nevertheless, some spectrometers are expensive and do not contemplate the entire spectrum. Despite this limitation, the main objective of the study was to create a soil spectral library of the Piauí State using only the 1000–2500 nm range. In this sense, it was evaluated and standardized the soil spectral library by accessing the combination of smoothing, standard normal variate, continuum removal, and Savitzky-Golay derivative spectral preprocessing procedures with partial least squares, random forest, and cubist machine learning algorithms. It was collected 262 geo-referenced soil samples at the layer of 0.00–0.20 m across the entire Piauí State, representing most of its soil variability. The soil properties evaluated were pH(H2O), sand, clay, and soil organic carbon (SOC) contents. This study demonstrated that the Standard Normal Variate was one of the most promising preprocessing procedures to improve model predictions for pH(H2O), sand, and clay. For SOC and pH, the best overall results were without preprocessing the soil spectra. Moreover, the cubist model was the most accurate in predicting soil properties. Finally, our study showed evidence of the potential and feasibility of using this soil spectral library to estimate soil properties such as pH(H2O), sand, clay, and SOC.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We are devising sustainable land use strategies for sloping uplands (≥18%) for the southern Philippines, with the current focus on the Cabulig catchment (22,900 ha). Digital soil mapping (DSM) will be used to create soil property maps at a suitable scale for on-ground planning and management (i.e., 1:100,000 scale). This paper describes the development and testing of a DSM sampling design to satisfy the dual needs of statistically-based sampling rigour for reliable soil estimations and field practicality in remote and rugged landscapes. The design combines the elements of: (i) conditioned Latin Hypercube sampling (cLHS), which performs maximally stratified random sampling in the presence of environmental covariates; (ii) sampling along toposequence-based transects for field efficiency; and (iii) nested interval sampling along the transects to 1,500 m in length to span the catchment ranges of soil variability. The geographic coordinates produced by cLHS (seed points) defined the location of transects from a random transect generating algorithm. Environmental covariates included satellite remote sensing and digital elevation models. Here we describe the outcome of a 2½ week trial conducted late last year to test the design in preparation of an extensive operational survey. The key findings are that 20 cLHS-derived sites gave a suitable geographic and environmental variable distribution of the catchment, offering the possibility of strong soil model development. Consideration should be given to reviewing the covariates used in the cLHS component so as to be more representative of the catchment’s pedogenic characteristics. If so, the legacy of existing samples should be preserved in the modification. The terminal sampling interval (1,500 m) proved overly costly in terms of field effort, hence could be shortened to 500 m. This offers the possibility of more transects to be sampled in the time allowed. Finally, in the field, the lack of understanding of cLHS site selection “logic” proved both intellectually and practically unsatisfactory. Ideas to address this issue are given.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper discusses the combined use of remotely sensed optical and radar data for the estimation and mapping of soil texture. The study is based on Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data acquired between July and early December 2017, on a semi-arid area about 3000 km2 in central Tunisia. In addition to satellite acquisitions, texture measurement samples were taken in several agricultural fields, characterized by a large range of clay contents (between 13% and 60%). For the period between July and August, various optical indicators of clay content Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands and soil indices) were tested over bare soils. Satellite moisture products, derived from combined S-1 and S-2 data, were also tested as an indicator of soil texture. Algorithms based on the support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) methods are proposed for the classification and mapping of clay content and a three-fold cross-validation is used to evaluate both approaches. The classifications with the best performance are achieved using the soil moisture indicator derived from combined S-1 and S-2 data, with overall accuracy (OA) of 63% and 65% for the SVM and RF classifications, respectively.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Different uses of soil legacy data such as training dataset as well as the selection of soil environmental covariables could drive the accuracy of machine learning techniques. Thus, this study evaluated the ability of the Random Forest algorithm to predict soil classes from different training datasets and extrapolate such information to a similar area. The following training datasets were extracted from legacy data: a) point data composed of 53 soil samples; b) 30 m buffer around the soil samples, and soil map polygons excluding: c) 20 m; and d) 30 m from the boundaries of polygons. These four datasets were submitted to principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce multidimensionality. Each dataset derived a new one. Different combinations of predictor variables were tested. A total of 52 models were evaluated by means of error of models, prediction uncertainty and external validation for overall accuracy and Kappa index. The best result was obtained by reducing the number of predictors with the PCA along with information from the buffer around the points. Although Random Forest has been considered a robust spatial predictor model, it was clear it is sensitive to different strategies of selecting training dataset. Effort was necessary to find the best training dataset for achieving a suitable level of accuracy of spatial prediction. To identify a specific dataset seems to be better than using a great number of variables or a large volume of training data. The efforts made allowed for the accurate acquisition of a mapped area 15.5 times larger than the reference area.</td>

It takes as inputs soil observations from about 240 000 locations worldwide and over 400 global environmental covariates describing vegetation, terrain morphology, climate, geology and hydrology. The aim of this work was the production of global maps of soil properties, with cross-validation, hyper-parameter selection and quantification of spatially explicit uncertainty, as implemented in the SoilGrids version 2.0 product incorporating state-of-the-art practices and adapting them for global digital soil mapping with legacy data. The paper presents the evaluation of the global predictions produced for soil organic carbon content, total nitrogen, coarse fragments, pH (water), cation exchange capacity, bulk density and texture fractions at six standard depths (up to 200 cm). The quantitative evaluation showed metrics in line with previous global, continental and large-region studies. The qualitative evaluation showed that coarse-scale patterns are well reproduced. The spatial uncertainty at global scale highlighted the need for more soil observations, especially in high-latitude regions.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Soils are widely recognized as a non-renewable natural resource and as biophysical carbon sinks. As such, there is a growing requirement for global soil information. Although several global soil information systems already exist, these tend to suffer from inconsistencies and limited spatial detail.<br>We present SoilGrids1km — a global 3D soil information system at 1 km resolution — containing spatial predictions for a selection of soil properties (at six standard depths): soil organic carbon (g kg−1), soil pH, sand, silt and clay fractions (%), bulk density (kg m−3), cation-exchange capacity (cmol+/kg), coarse fragments (%), soil organic carbon stock (t ha−1), depth to bedrock (cm), World Reference Base soil groups, and USDA Soil Taxonomy suborders. Our predictions are based on global spatial prediction models which we fitted, per soil variable, using a compilation of major international soil profile databases (ca. 110,000 soil profiles), and a selection of ca. 75 global environmental covariates representing soil forming factors. Results of regression modeling indicate that the most useful covariates for modeling soils at the global scale are climatic and biomass indices (based on MODIS images), lithology, and taxonomic mapping units derived from conventional soil survey (Harmonized World Soil Database). Prediction accuracies assessed using 5–fold cross-validation were between 23–51%.<br>SoilGrids1km provide an initial set of examples of soil spatial data for input into global models at a resolution and consistency not previously available. Some of the main limitations of the current version of SoilGrids1km are: (1) weak relationships between soil properties/classes and explanatory variables due to scale mismatches, (2) difficulty to obtain covariates that capture soil forming factors, (3) low sampling density and spatial clustering of soil profile locations. However, as the SoilGrids system is highly automated and flexible, increasingly accurate predictions can be generated as new input data become available.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: This paper describes the technical development and accuracy assessment of the most recent and improved version of the SoilGrids system at 250m resolution (June 2016 update). SoilGrids provides global predictions for standard numeric soil properties (organic carbon, bulk density, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), pH, soil texture fractions and coarse fragments) at seven standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm), in addition to predictions of depth to bedrock and distribution of soil classes based on the World Reference Base (WRB) and USDA classification systems (ca. 280 raster layers in total). Predictions were based on ca. 150,000 soil profiles used for training and a stack of 158 remote sensing-based soil covariates (primarily derived from MODIS land products, SRTM DEM derivatives, climatic images and global landform and lithology maps), which were used to fit an ensemble of machine learning methods—random forest and gradient boosting and/or multinomial logistic regression—as implemented in the R packages ranger, xgboost, nnet and caret. The results of 10–fold cross-validation show that the ensemble models explain between 56% (coarse fragments) and 83% (pH) of variation with an overall average of 61%. Improvements in the relative accuracy considering the amount of variation explained, in comparison to the previous version of SoilGrids at 1 km spatial resolution, range from 60 to 230%. Improvements can be attributed to: (1) the use of machine learning instead of linear regression, (2) to considerable investments in preparing finer resolution covariate layers and (3) to insertion of additional soil profiles. Further development of SoilGrids could include refinement of methods to incorporate input uncertainties and derivation of posterior probability distributions (per pixel), and further automation of spatial modeling so that soil maps can be generated for potentially hundreds of soil variables. Another area of future research is the development of methods for multiscale merging of SoilGrids predictions with local and/or national gridded soil products (e.g. up to 50 m spatial resolution) so that increasingly more accurate, complete and consistent global soil information can be produced.

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Accurate prediction of soil organic carbon (SOC) at fine scales is frequently limited by data availability but fine-scale maps of soil properties are often of great importance for local agricultural land management and watershed processes assessment. Terrain attributes derived from elevation have been commonly used predictor variables in SOC mapping. The aim of this study is to map SOC density (0–30 cm) using hybrid methods that combine regional topographic models and a residual kriging procedure using local samples from an area of interest and evaluate the effects of different sampling designs for residual kriging on final map quality. The regional topographic model was developed based on light detection and ranging (lidar)-derived topographic covariates using random forest to map SOC density on a cropland site intensively sampled for SOC (n = 224). To test ability to generate a local calibration of this regional model, a second intensively sampled cropland site (n = 225) was used to generate a reference SOC density map where residual kriging was implemented involving different numbers of local samples (n = 10–255) and different sample selection schemes: stratified random sampling (SRS) and spatial coverage sampling with close-pairs inclusions (SCS+). To generate a population of local sample sets, 500 repeats were conducted for each scheme from the reference map. By analyzing the distribution of relative mean error (RME) of the overall map for the second site with repeated selection of local samples, we found a smaller variation in RME for SCS+ than that for SRS for a given sample size. However, the E(RME) estimates for SCS+ slightly varied with number of local samples used while the E(RME) for SRS was stabilized at zero over that range in local sampling intensity. There was negligible difference between the distributions of RME for the two sampling schemes at individual points, except a finding of somewhat lower RME for SCS+ based point estimates. These results indicate that SCS+ can generate smaller variation in overall map quality while SRS can provide unbiased mean estimate for an area of interest. This study demonstrates the utility of extrapolating a regional topographic model by use of a limited number of new samples for local calibration and provides insight for practitioners who are interested in mapping soil carbon distribution in sparsely sampled areas of interest.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The purpose of the study is to map the spatial variation of major soil properties in Bukkarayasamudrum mandal of Anantapur district, India using Random Forest model. The study area is divided into different Physiographic Land Units (PLU) based on landform, landuse and slope. Random Forest model (RFM) was developed based on field survey data of 116 surface samples (0–30 cm) representing all major PLU units of the study area. RFM is neither sensitive to over fitting nor to noise features and has capacity to handle large datasets. High resolution satellite imagery (IRS LISS IV data- 3 bands), terrain attributes such as elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index, topographic position index, plan &amp; profile curvature, Multi-resolution index of valley bottom flatness and Multi-resolution ridge top flatness, Vegetation factors like NDVI, EVI and land use land cover (LULC) are used as covariates along with legacy soil data of 1:50,000 scale. The predicted organic carbon, pH and EC ranged from 0.24–1.03%, 6.9–9.0, 0.11–0.97 dsm− 1 respectively. The model performance was evaluated based on Coefficient of determination (R2) and Lin's Concordance coefficient (CCC). The model performed well with R2 and CCC values of 0.23 and 0.38 for SOC, 0.30 and 0.37 for pH, and 0.62 and 0.70 for EC respectively. Variable importance ranking of RFM model showed that EVI and NDVI are the most important predictors for organic carbon whereas drainage and NDVI for EC and pH respectively. This technique can be applied to similar landscapes with more observations to refine the spatial resolution of soil properties.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We evaluated the suitability and performance of boosted regression trees (BRT) as a potential technique for soil mapping using a limited point dataset in an arid region of Iran. The model was applied using two approaches: logistic-BRT as an indirect approach and multiclass-BRT as a direct approach to produce soil class maps. In indirect prediction, the occurrence of relevant diagnostic horizons was first mapped and various maps were then combined for a pixel-wise classification by combining the presence or absence of diagnostic horizons. To allow combination of the indicator maps for classification into great groups, a decision tree was defined for linking the occurrence of diagnostic horizons to a soil great group. In direct prediction, the dependent variable was the great group itself and; therefore, the probability distribution of the soil great groups was directly predicted. Auxiliary data used in this study to represent predictive soil forming factors were terrain attributes and Landsat data as quantitative variables and a geomorphology map as categorical variable. To assess the added value of the geomorphology map, the most laborious auxiliary variable to obtain, the BRT-performance of 2 data situations was compared: (i) using only the DEM and remote sensing covariates and (ii) additionally using the geomorphology map. Results showed that the geomorphology map contributed importantly to the prediction accuracy. When it was removed from the predictors, the prediction accuracy strongly decreased. The maximum reduction in predictive performance of both indirect and direct models occurred in the absence of geomorphology map, particularly for soil classes whose presence has direct relationship with geomorphic surfaces. Generally, poor predictions seemed to be mainly due to low sample size, high variability of ancillary predictors and the inability of the geomorphology map to differentiate the strata in detail. In most predictions, the purity was better for the direct model. The indirect method predicted a high probability of salic horizon in playa landform, gypsic horizon in gypsiferous hills and calcic horizon in alluvial fans. The indirect method could provide an insight into the causes of errors in prediction at the level of diagnostic horizons, which could help in selecting better covariates.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Spatial prediction of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock from concentration and bulk density measurements typically employs a two-step procedure. First, SOC concentration and bulk density data are used to calculate the SOC stock at each data location. Second, the calculated SOC stock at each data location is interpolated to give predictions at unsampled locations, often by applying a univariate geostatistical method to the stock. We refer to this as a ‘calculate-then-model’ approach. In this study, we investigate an alternative method to predict SOC stock at unsampled locations, based on a ‘model-then-calculate’ approach. We first consider the spatial covariation of the SOC concentration and bulk density data. This covariation can be modelled using a multivariate geostatistical approach, namely, the linear model of coregionalisation (LMCR), which deals with data on two (or more) correlated variables that together exhibit spatial correlation. The LMCR can be used to calculate a multivariate prediction distribution at an unsampled location for SOC concentration and bulk density in all depth intervals (for which observations were made). A prediction of the SOC stock can subsequently be calculated from this distribution. We compare the ‘calculate-then-model’ and ‘model-then-calculate’ approaches using data on SOC concentrations and bulk densities from croplands across Queensland, Australia. Cross-validation results show that the two approaches give similar prediction accuracies and reasonable uncertainty assessments. Therefore, the more simple ‘calculate-then-model’ approach might be favoured when both SOC concentration and bulk density measurements are available at all data locations. However, when some locations have just SOC concentration data — a commonly encountered situation due to difficulties in obtaining bulk density measurements under field conditions — then the ‘model-then-calculate’ approach offers a useful alternative; we show that it still gives good predictions and a fair assessment of uncertainty in this situation. We also show the importance of the LMCR for modelling the correlation between SOC concentration and bulk density data for the different depth intervals within a ‘model-then-calculate’ approach; if this correlation is not accounted for (i.e. modelling of the SOC concentration and bulk density data for the different depth intervals is performed independently), then very poor uncertainty assessments result.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Estimation of soil organic matter (SOM) at unsampled locations is crucial in agronomical and environmental studies. In this study, the ability of geostatistical methods such as ordinary kriging (OK), simple kriging (SK) and cokriging (CK) and hybrid geostatistical methods such as regression-simple kriging (RSK)/-ordinary kriging (ROK) and artificial neural network-simple kriging (ANNSK)/-ordinary kriging (ANNOK) was evaluated to predict SOM content. To this end, a set of 100 soil samples were collected from 0 to 15 cm depth of agricultural soils in Selin plain, northwest of Iran. The organic carbon was measured using Walkley–Black method. An auxiliary variable was provided by remote sensing data (Landsat 7 ETM +). Three performance criteria including mean error (ME), root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) were used to evaluate the performance of the derived models. The results showed that the ANN model that used principal components (PCs) as input variables, performed better than the multiple linear regression (MLR) model. The hybrid geostatistical methods, which include ANNOK, ANNSK, ROK and RSK provided more reliable predictions than the geostatistical methods, which include SK, OK and CK. In general, the best prediction method for the estimation of SOM spatial distribution was the ANNOK model, which had the smallest RMSE (0.271%) and the highest R2 (0.633). It was concluded that information from Landsat ETM + imagery is potential auxiliary variables for improving spatial prediction, monitoring SOM and development of high quality SOM maps, which is the primary step in site-specific soil management.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Effective soil-sampling is essential for the construction of prescription maps used in Precision Agriculture for Variable Rate Application of nutrients. In practice, designing a field sampling plan is subject to hard limitations, merely due to the associated expenses, where only a few sample points are taken for evaluation. The accuracy of constructed maps is affected by the number of sampling points, their geographical dispersion and their coverage of the feature space. To improve the accuracy, ancillary data in the form of low-cost, high-resolution field scans could be used for inferring statistical measures for devising the high-cost sampling plan. The current study targets algorithmically-guided sampling plans using available ancillary data. We propose possible models for quantifying spatial coverage and diversity concerning the ancillary data. We investigate models as objective functions, devise Pareto optimization problems and solve them using NSGA-II. We analyzed the obtained sampling plans in an agricultural field, and suggest statistical tools for sample-size determination and plans' ranking according to additional information criteria. We argue that our approach is successful in attaining a practical sampling plan, constituting a fine trade-off between objectives, and possessing no discrepancies.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The goal of the Water Smart Agriculture (WSA) program is to improve food security in Central America through changes in policies, programs, and practices in water use efficiency. The Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) project is a component of WSA that aims to create human capital with knowledge and skills in sustainable soil and water management through the production of informative soil maps, under the guiding principle of “managing soils to manage water”. DSM provides a platform for producing detailed maps of soil types, properties and functions. However, the transition of DSM from research to operational levels brings a new set of challenges related to input, data processing and outputs. The major challenges identified during the pilot stage of the DSM project were: (i) soil data availability, quality and compatibility; (ii) lack of DSM skills; and (iii) lack of product delivery platforms. Training based on pilot projects was conducted to build local DSM capacity and infrastructure and incorporate tacit knowledge. Expanding from pilot stage to national level required the establishment of DSM teams that are multi-institutional and interdisciplinary. In order to achieve buy-in from the local and national governments, the DSM teams were comprised of members from public institutions and professional organizations and they adopted a participatory DSM approach and produced functional soil maps capable of supporting decisions at multiple levels.</td>

The present work concerns the application of multivariate statistical methods to a soil data base from the province of Styria (Austria) to delineate polluted areas and to distinguish between different types of pollution. The soil data base comprised pedological, geochemical and geological data and was extended by magnetic susceptibility measurements to further test the suitability of magnetic susceptibility as a tracer for pollution. Topsoil data from 521 locations were analysed by fuzzy c-means cluster analysis and non-linear mapping. Robust cluster solutions grouped the database according to the geological background and the land use at the sampling sites. The extraction of information on heavy metal pollution appeared to be possible by analysing the geological units separately and reducing the variables to those indicative for the pollution. The link between magnetic susceptibility and the heavy metal content, which was too complex to be described by bivariate statistics, was revealed by the multivariate methods.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Information on soil properties is crucial for soil preservation, the improvement of food security, and the provision of ecosystem services. In particular, for the African continent, spatially explicit information on soils and their ability to sustain these services is still scarce. To address data gaps, infrared spectroscopy has achieved great success as a cost-effective solution to quantify soil properties in recent decades. Here, we present a mid-infrared soil spectral library (SSL) for central Africa (CSSL) that can predict key soil properties, allowing for future soil estimates with a minimal need for expensive and time-consuming wet chemistry. Currently, our CSSL contains over 1800 soil samples from 10 distinct geoclimatic regions throughout the Congo Basin and along the Albertine Rift. For the analysis, we selected six regions from the CSSL, for which we built predictive models for total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) using an existing continental SSL (African Soil Information Service, AfSIS SSL; n=1902) that does not include central African soils. Using memory-based learning (MBL), we explored three different strategies at decreasing degrees of geographic extrapolation, using models built with (1) the AfSIS SSL only, (2) AfSIS SSL combined with the five remaining central African regions, and (3) a combination of AfSIS SSL, the remaining five regions, and selected samples from the target region (spiking). For this last strategy we introduce a method for spiking MBL models. We found that when using the AfSIS SSL only to predict the six central African regions, the root mean square error of the predictions (RMSEpred) was between 3.85–8.74 and 0.40–1.66 g kg−1 for TC and TN, respectively. The ratio of performance to the interquartile distance (RPIQpred) ranged between 0.96–3.95 for TC and 0.59–2.86 for TN. While the effect of the second strategy compared to the first strategy was mixed, the third strategy, spiking with samples from the target regions, could clearly reduce the RMSEpred to 3.19–7.32 g kg−1 for TC and 0.24–0.89 g kg−1 for TN. RPIQpred values were increased to ranges of 1.43–5.48 and 1.62–4.45 for TC and TN, respectively. In general, predicted TC and TN for soils of each of the six regions were accurate; the effect of spiking and avoiding geographical extrapolation was noticeably large. We conclude that our CSSL adds valuable soil diversity that can improve predictions for the Congo Basin region compared to using the continental AfSIS SSL alone; thus, analyses of other soils in central Africa will be able to profit from a more diverse spectral feature space. Given these promising results, the library comprises an important tool to facilitate economical soil analyses and predict soil properties in an understudied yet critical region of Africa. Our SSL is openly available for application and for enlargement with more spectral and reference data to further improve soil diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Lithology describes the geochemical, mineralogical, and physical properties of rocks. It plays a key role in many processes at the Earth surface, especially the fluxes of matter to soils, ecosystems, rivers, and oceans. Understanding these processes at the global scale requires a high resolution description of lithology. A new high resolution global lithological map (GLiM) was assembled from existing regional geological maps translated into lithological information with the help of regional literature. The GLiM represents the rock types of the Earth surface with 1,235,400 polygons. The lithological classification consists of three levels. The first level contains 16 lithological classes comparable to previously applied definitions in global lithological maps. The additional two levels contain 12 and 14 subclasses, respectively, which describe more specific rock attributes. According to the GLiM, the Earth is covered by 64% sediments (a third of which are carbonates), 13% metamorphics, 7% plutonics, and 6% volcanics, and 10% are covered by water or ice. The high resolution of the GLiM allows observation of regional lithological distributions which often vary from the global average. The GLiM enables regional analysis of Earth surface processes at global scales. A gridded version of the GLiM is available at the PANGEA Database (http://dx.doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.788537).</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Spatial sampling schemes are mainly developed to determine sampling locations that can cover the variation of environmental properties in the area of interest. Here we proposed the variance quadtree algorithm for sampling in an area with prior information represented as ancillary or secondary environmental data, and the covariance structure of the ancillary variable is non-stationary. The algorithm is based on the idea of a quadtree decomposition, where an area is successively divided into strata so each stratum has more-or-less equal variation. An observation point is then placed inside each stratum. This scheme samples sparsely in relatively uniform areas and more intensively where variation is large. It samples in the feature space and also takes into consideration the spread in the geographic space. We describe the algorithm, its software implementation, and present some examples of applications.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: To cope with the challenges in forest management that are contemporarily caused by climate change, data on current chemical and physical soil properties are more and more necessary. For this purpose, we present a further amalgam of depth functions and SCORPAN modelling to provide data at arbitrary depth layers. In this concept, regionalisation is split up into the modelling of plot totals and the estimation of vertical distributions. The intended benefits by splitting up are: consistency between estimates on plot level and depth layer level, avoidance of artificial depth gradients, straightforward interpretation of covariates in the sense of pedogenetic processes, and circumnavigation of the propagation of uncertainties associated with separation between horizons during field sampling. The methodology was tailored to the circumstances within the north-eastern lowlands and the utilisation of current inventory data of the National Forest Soil Inventory (NFSI) in Brandenburg (Germany). Using the regionalisation of soil organic carbon (SOC) as an example, the application is demonstrated and discussed in detail. The depth to groundwater table and terrain parameters related to the catchment area were the main factors in SOC storage. The use of kriging did not improve the model performance. The relative depth gradients of SOC were especially distinguished by tree species composition and stand age. We suppose that interesting fields of application may be found in scenario-based modelling of SOC and when SOC serves as a basis for hydrological modelling.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The conversion of point observations to a geographic field is a necessary step in soil mapping. For pursuing goals of mapping soil carbon at the landscape scale, the relationships between sampling scale, representation of spatial variation, and accuracy of estimated error need to be considered. This study examines the spatial patterns and accuracy of predictions made by different spatial modelling methods on sample sets taken at two different scales. These spatial models are then tested on independent validation sets taken at three different scales. Each spatial modelling method produced similar, but unique, maps of soil organic carbon content (SOC%). Kriging approaches excelled at internal spatial prediction with more densely spaced sample points. Because kriging depends on spatial autocorrelation, kriging performance was naturally poor in areas of spatial extrapolation. In contrast, the spatial regression approaches tested could continue to perform well in spatial extrapolation areas. However, the problem of induction allowed the potential for problems in some areas, which was less predictable. This problem also existed for the kriging approaches. Spatial phenomena occurring between sampling points could also be missed by kriging models. Use of covariates with kriging can help, but the requirement of capturing the full feature space in the map remains. Methods that utilize spatial association, such as spatial regression, can map soil properties for landscape scales at a high resolution, but are highly dependent on the inclusion of the full attribute space in the calibration of the model and the availability of transferable covariates.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Digital soil mapping (DSM) products represent estimates of spatially distributed soil properties. These estimations comprise an element of uncertainty that is not evenly distributed over the area covered by DSM. If we quantify the uncertainty spatially explicit, this information can be used to improve the quality of DSM by optimizing the sampling design. This study follows a DSM approach using a Random Forest regression model, legacy soil samples, and terrain covariates to estimate topsoil silt and clay contents in a small catchment of 4.2 km2 in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, Central China. We aim (i) to introduce a method to derive spatial uncertainty, and (ii) to improve the initial DSM approaches by additional sampling that is guided by the spatial uncertainty. The proposed uncertainty measure is based on multiple realizations of individual and randomized decision tree models. We used the spatial uncertainty of the initial DSM approaches to stratify the study area and thereby to identify potential sampling areas of high uncertainties. Further, we tested how precisely available legacy samples cover the variability of the covariates within each potential sampling area to define the final sampling area and to apply a purposive sampling design. For the final Random Forest model calibration, we combined the legacy sample set with the additional samples. This uncertainty-driven DSM refinement was evaluated by comparing it to a second approach. In this second approach, the additional samples were replaced by a random sample set of the same size, obtained from the entire study area. For the comparative analysis, external, bootstrap-, and cross-validation was applied. The DSM approach using the uncertainty-driven refinement performed best. The averaged spatial uncertainty was reduced by 31% for silt and by 27% for clay compared to the initial DSM approach. Using external validation, the accuracy increased by the same proportions, while showing an overall accuracy of R2 = 0.59 for silt and R2 = 0.56 for clay.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The Sentinel-2 mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus program provides multispectral remote sensing data at decametric spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. The objective of this work is to evaluate the ability of Sentinel-2 time-series data to enable classification of an inherent biophysical property, in terms of accuracy and uncertainty estimation. The tested inherent biophysical property was the soil texture. Soil texture classification was performed on each individual Sentinel-2 image with a linear support vector machine. Two sources of uncertainty were studied: uncertainties due to the Sentinel-2 acquisition date and uncertainties due to the soil sample selection in the training dataset. The first uncertainty analysis was achieved by analyzing the diversity of classification results obtained from the time series of soil texture classifications, considering that the temporal resolution is akin to a repetition of spectral measurements. The second uncertainty analysis was achieved from each individual Sentinel-2 image, based on a bootstrapping procedure corresponding to 100 independent classifications obtained with different training data. The Simpson index was used to compute this diversity in the classification results. This work was carried out in an Indian cultivated region (84 km2, part of Berambadi catchment, in the Karnataka state). It used a time-series of six Sentinel-2 images acquired from February to April 2017 and 130 soil surface samples, collected over the study area and characterized in terms of texture. The classification analysis showed the following: (i) each single-date image analysis resulted in moderate performances for soil texture classification, and (ii) high confusion was obtained between neighboring textural classes, and low confusion was obtained between remote textural classes. The uncertainty analysis showed that (i) the classification of remote textural classes (clay and sandy loam) was more certain than classifications of intermediate classes (sandy clay and sandy clay loam), (ii) a final soil textural map can be produced depending on the allowed uncertainty, and iii) a higher level of allowed uncertainty leads to increased bare soil coverage. These results illustrate the potential of Sentinel-2 for providing input for modeling environmental processes and crop management.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Digital soil mapping (DSM) has been widely used as a cost-effective method for generating soil maps. However, current DSM data representation rarely incorporates contextual information of the landscape. DSM models are usually calibrated using point observations intersected with spatially corresponding point covariates. Here, we demonstrate the use of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model that incorporates contextual information surrounding an observation to significantly improve the prediction accuracy over conventional DSM models. We describe a CNN model that takes inputs as images of covariates and explores spatial contextual information by finding non-linear local spatial relationships of neighbouring pixels. Unique features of the proposed model include input represented as a 3-D stack of images, data augmentation to reduce overfitting, and the simultaneous prediction of multiple outputs. Using a soil mapping example in Chile, the CNN model was trained to simultaneously predict soil organic carbon at multiples depths across the country. The results showed that, in this study, the CNN model reduced the error by 30 % compared with conventional techniques that only used point information of covariates. In the example of country-wide mapping at 100 m resolution, the neighbourhood size from 3 to 9 pixels is more effective than at a point location and larger neighbourhood sizes. In addition, the CNN model produces less prediction uncertainty and it is able to predict soil carbon at deeper soil layers more accurately. Because the CNN model takes the covariate represented as images, it offers a simple and effective framework for future DSM models.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques are widely employed to generate soil maps. Soil properties are typically predicted individually, while ignoring the interrelation between them. Models for predicting multiple properties exist, but they are computationally demanding and often fail to provide accurate description of the associated uncertainty. In this paper a convolutional neural network (CNN) model is described to predict several soil properties with quantified uncertainty. CNN has the advantage that it incorporates spatial contextual information of environmental covariates surrounding an observation. A single CNN model can be trained to predict multiple soil properties simultaneously. I further propose a two-step approach to estimate the uncertainty of the prediction for mapping using a neural network model. The methodology is tested mapping six soil properties on the French metropolitan territory using measurements from the LUCAS dataset and a large set of environmental covariates portraying the factors of soil formation. Results indicate that the multivariate CNN model produces accurate maps as shown by the coefficient of determination and concordance correlation coefficient, compared to a conventional machine learning technique. For this country extent mapping, the maps predicted by CNN have a detailed pattern with significant spatial variation. Evaluation of the uncertainty maps using the median of the standardized squared prediction error and accuracy plots suggests that the uncertainty was accurately quantified, albeit slightly underestimated. The tests conducted using different window size of input covariates to predict the soil properties indicate that CNN benefits from using local contextual information in a radius of 4.5 km. I conclude that CNN is an effective model to predict several soil properties and that the associated uncertainty can be accurately quantified with the proposed approach.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy allows the rapid acquisition of soil information in the field or the laboratory. The vis-NIR spectroscopy research enthusiasm around the world has created regional to global soil spectral libraries. While machine learning methods have been utilised in processing spectral data, such large regional datasets are better dealt with big data analytics. Deep learning is an exciting discipline that has already transformed the way data are analysed in many fields and could also change the way we model soil spectral data. This study developed and evaluated convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning algorithm, as a new way to predict soil properties from raw soil spectra. We demonstrated the effectiveness of CNNs on the LUCAS soil database, which consists of around 20,000 topsoil observations with physicochemical and biological properties from Europe. To fully utilise the capacity of the CNN model, we represented the soil spectral data as a 2-dimensional spectrogram, showing the reflectance as a function of wavelength and frequency. We showed the capacity of a CNN to be trained in a multi-task setting to simultaneously predict six soil properties in one model (OC, CEC, clay, sand, pH, total N). Compared with conventional methods such as PLS regression and Cubist regression tree, the CNN performed significantly better, especially the multi-tasking model. In the case of soil organic carbon prediction, the multi-task CNN decreased the error by 87% compared to PLS and 62% compared with Cubist. This approach proved to be effective when trained on a relatively large dataset. The high accuracy of CNN makes it an ideal tool for modelling soil spectral data.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of model averaging (ensemble modelling) as an approach for combining digital soil property maps derived from disaggregated legacy soil class maps and scorpan kriging (using soil point data). The study is based in the Dalrymple Shire, QLD and continues on the soil pH mapping work of Odgers et al. (2014a). Equal weights averaging (EW), Bates–Granger or variance weighted averaging (VW), Granger–Ramanathan averaging (GRA), and Bayesian model averaging (BMA) were compared in this study. Model averaged predictions were estimated to 2 m depth at regular depth intervals. 90% prediction intervals of the model averaged predictions were derived numerically. Neither the disaggregated soil map nor the scorpan kriging map was particularly accurate. Predictions from model averaging however did improve upon the accuracy, where at all depths, the combined predictions were an improvement on using either of the contributing soil maps alone. We recommend the use of GRA for digital soil mapping applications because its performance is equal to or better than the generally preferred BMA approach, yet far simpler to implement, and is computationally efficient. For regional soil studies where polygon mapping and soil point data are available, ensemble modelling is a useful combinatorial approach.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: We introduce a software tool for optimal sampling design in the context of farm-scale soil carbon auditing, where the amount of sequestered soil carbon will be estimated from a random sample. Existing tools do not use available ancillary information, or do not have the functionality needed for farm-scale soil carbon auditing. Using a grid of predicted carbon content with associated uncertainty, the software optimises a stratified random sampling design, such that the profit is maximised on the basis of sequestered carbon price, sampling costs, and a trading parameter that balances farmer's and buyer's risks due to uncertainty of the estimated amount of sequestered carbon. As the algorithm is computationally intensive, the package is written in Julia for speed. From a case study we conclude that our software is an effective tool for farm-scale soil carbon auditing, and that it outperforms the existing tools in terms of efficiency and functionality.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Soil-sample collection and strategy are costly and time-consuming endeavors, mainly when the goal is in-field variation mapping that usually requires dense sampling. This study developed and tested a streamlined soil mapping methodology, applicable at the field scale, based on an unsupervised classification of Sentinel-2 (S2) data supporting the definition of reduced soil-sampling schemes. The study occurred in two agricultural fields of 20 hectares each near Deruta, Umbria, Italy. S2 images were acquired for the two bare fields. After a band selection based on bibliography, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and cluster analysis were used to identify points of two reduced-sample schemes. The data obtained by these samplings were used in linear regressions with principal components of the selected S2 bands to produce maps for clay and organic matter (OM). Resultant maps were assessed by analyzing residuals with a conventional soil sampling of 30 soil samples for each field to quantify their accuracy level. Although of limited extent and with a specific focus, the low average errors (Clay ± 2.71%, OM ± 0.16%) we obtained using only three soil samples suggest a wider potential for this methodology. The proposed approach, integrating S2 data and traditional soil-sampling methods could considerably reduce soil-sampling time and costs in ordinary and precision agriculture applications.</td>

	<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this study we validated digital soil maps of clay content at different spatial supports; point, 48 m blocks and soil–land use complexes (SLU). The aim being to examine the change in prediction quality with different prediction supports. Digital soil maps of clay content at depths of 0–10 cm, 10–30 cm and 30–50 cm were created using linear mixed models, legacy soil data and readily available covariates such as digital terrain attributes, landsat and gamma radiometrics. A random stratified sampling design was used to collect an independent validation dataset. There was little change in the accuracy between the point (RMSE = 15.7% for 0–10 cm, 17.4% for 10–30 cm, 15.2% for 30–50 cm) and 48 m block supports (RMSE = 15.5% for 0–10 cm, 17.1% for 10–30 cm, 13.5% for 30–50 cm). However the prediction quality was much improved at the support of the SLUs (RMSE = 9.5% for 0–10 cm, 10.1% for 10–30 cm and 5.1% for 30–50 cm). It is a standard practice in digital soil mapping studies to validate at the point support but our results show that this is likely to represent the worst case scenario for assessing their prediction quality. Further work should consider finding optimal prediction supports for creating digital soil maps.</td>
